They encountered reports of a 429 error code translating to too many errors.\n\nArchitectural stack :\nAdobe Experience Manager 2025.3.20133.20250325T063357Z-250300\nAdobe Experience Manager Forms 2025.03.13.02-250300\n\nInvestigation :\nChecking the CDN logs, I could only see more than ~3000 entries of status code \"429\". Mapping the entries with the AEM servers for these requests, I can see AEM returning 404/500 for lots of requests with errors like [0].\nDuring these two hours, there have been 1000s of stack traces varying from NPE to OakConstraints have been logged on customer's Forms environment (cm-p128803-e1252506)\n\nAs for the service disruption though most of them are not originating from the Forms classes but rather the custom code classes where it seems certain changes has been made.\n\n\n[0] GET /content/chevrolet/na/us/en/index/vehicles/2025/trucks/silverado-ev/overview.html HTTP/1.1]

To view drafts and submissions, users must be logged in at the time of form submission.\nAlso customer was wondering since this includes a solution which includes SITES and they are using only Forms, Is there any other solution / best practices our Adobe can suggest for the same:\n\n1. Is there any best practices / suggestion on this other than the solution [0]? If they were to build a secure custom logic to capture the form data and save it to a third-party Cloud Storage, will that be a safe option\n2.

Create a custom view extending the base component (like radio button) following this pattern:\n<https://github.com/adobe/aem-core-forms-components/blob/master/ui.af.apps/src/main/content/jcr_root/apps/core/fd/components/form/radiobutton/v1/radiobutton/clientlibs/site/js/radiobuttonview.js#L164>\n\n2.

    "answer": "--&gt; The Production and Stage environment is rolled back to the previous version, and now your forms are working correctly. DEV is still on the latest version, in case that needs to be rollback another request needs to be raised.\n\n--&gt; AEM as a Cloud Service implements a new, continuous delivery pipeline for the AEM codebase, with automated updates up to several times a month. This solves one of the main challenges of AEM applications by keeping you current on the most recent version.\nThe customer environments were in the RO, and that is the default and recommended approach, and the upgrades are automatic for all the environments. The Feature updates are rolled out at the same time, one by one, on each environment: DEV, Stage, and Prod.\n\n--&gt; Discount Tyre is currently out of RO because of rollback.\n\n--&gt; First, the customer needs to fix their custom code, then test the changes in your dev environment, and once confirmed that the issue is fixed, we will upgrade the stage and prod. And then re-enable on RO.\n\n--&gt; The documentation pointed by Deke[0]. This happens when a customer is out of RO and has made a request to make the upgrade process manual.\nBy default and as the recommended approach, the customers are in RO, and automatic updates take place on the customer environment in all environments.\n\n[0]:<https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/implementing/deploying/aem-version-updates>"

    "answer": "```As discussed over the call, an issue with form submissions where forms with Document of Record (Dor) enabled were failing, while those without Dor were working fine. \nThe Issue is in Dev Author, Stage Author, and Stage Publisher. The same use case is working in Dev Publisher.\n\nThe issue was specifically with forms that had Dor enabled, while forms without Dor were functioning correctly. Four forms without Dor were working fine, while those with Dor were failing. This observation was consistent across different environments, indicating a specific issue with Dor-enabled forms. Identified that forms with Dor had a send email submission type, while those without Dor had a different submission type, such as submitting to a REST endpoint.\n\nWe suggested creating a new test form to isolate whether the issue was with the Dor or the send email combination. \nWe checked the template and content policies to ensure they were correctly configured and published. Found that the template was published, but the issue persisted. The content policies were in place, but the issue continued, suggesting that the problem was elsewhere. Suggested enabling the property for adaptive forms in the template and checking if it resolved the issue. The customer made the changes and tested the form, but the issue persisted, indicating that the problem was not related to the adaptive forms configuration.\n\nThe forms were working fine on non-enhanced security environments, but the issue was present on the enhanced security servers.\nThe email server was enabled in the advanced networking settings.\n\nOn Dev Author, the Document of Record (Dor) was related to a call to a different pod[0], which was failing due to an access token error. This error was causing the submission to fail when Dor was enabled. However, there was a different error on Stage Author and Stage Publisher.\nAs discussed over the call, all the forms are now working in all the environments.

CSS Conflicts:\n\n- The default CSS of the template is overriding the customer’s custom CSS.\n\n- The .hidden class in the default CSS is blocking other components from displaying correctly.\n\n3. CAPTCHA Accessibility Issues:\n\n- The CAPTCHA component is missing type labels and includes unnecessary tags in its HTML structure, leading to accessibility concerns.\n\nInvestigation so far:\n\n- We are able to replicate the scenario on our in house cloud instance.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n\n1. Create an adaptive form using AEM Forms reference content v2.1.0 template.\n\n2. Inspect the form using dev tool and search with string \"guideContainerFormSubmitButton\".

    "answer": "Hi <@U06KWF01666>,  Please find the below analysis here for issue #1 and #2\n1. As far as hidden submit button with class `guideContainerFormSubmitButton` is concerned, it is added by Form Container component [0]. This is not specific to any template. It is part of product and should be present in any form created using any foundation component template. The purpose of the submit button is a dummy submit for capturing data for auto-fill use case. If this is causing any accessibility issue, this can be fixed by adding `aria-hidden=\"true\"` to the html element. Please raise an accessibility issue for the same.\n2. For issue about `.hidden` class, this is very generic class name to represent `display:none` . Please ask customer to remove this class whenever navigation link is clicked, add it back when toggled. Removing it from the theme will cause other issues, and purpose of adding hidden class is to keep the element hidden applying `display:none` . The current style attributes for the `.hidden`  class is being defined by thirdparty bootstrap library bundled in common theme being used by .\ncc : <@W4R5LUPK3>, <@W4XTCQ07J>, <@W4R5M9P4H>\n\n[0] - <https://git.corp.adobe.com/livecycle/cq-guides/blob/master/content/src/main/resources/libs/fd/af/components/guideContainer/guideContainer.jsp#L417>\n[1] - <https://git.corp.adobe.com/livecycle/cq-guides/blob/master/content/src/main/resources/libs/fd/af/runtime/clientlibs/third-party/css/bootstrap-selected.css#L1555-L1557|https://git.corp.adobe.com/livecycle/cq-guides/blob/master/content/src/main/resources/[…]f/runtime/clientlibs/third-party/css/bootstrap-selected.css>"

    "answer": "> Visibility hidden property with important is causing issues. Important property in CSS takes precedence over other styles, which is causing the problem.\nFor this problem, I am recommending that class `hidden`  should be removed for the div block to be displayed whenever. Add `hidden`  class back when it needs to be hidden. This is general best practice. Leaving hidden class as is for a div block being displayed doesn't make sense. Once this class is removed dynamically from the div, the bootstrap styling won't be effective anymore, and the block will be visible. The purpose of hidden class is to keep the element hidden, therefore bootstrap library enforces it using `!important` . We need to ensure that we are following styling best practices."

Which is causing the button to appear in a default gray color.\n> \n> Font family is being overridden by the form CSS, causing custom font family to be replaced with Arial.\nBy default, the form element styling is enforced by the theme applied to the form.\nIf the customer wants a different colour button within the form, there are two ways.\n1. Create a custom theme and make required styling changes and apply the theme to the form\n2. If styling changes are required for only few elements, style layer in editor can be used as well.\nSimilarly `font-family` can be configured at page level element in the custom theme.\nCustom client library should be used for the cases which can't be achieved through theme.\nSo, our recommendation is to create a custom theme [0], and make button, font-family and other form element related changes and apply it to the form.\n\nIt seems customer has defined all forms related styling in a client library - <https://www.ebrd.com/etc.clientlibs/ebrd_dxp/clientlibs/clientlib-site.lc-14cdd813dc9a15d4b6c870a892050e23-lc.min.css>\nThis is not a good practice in my opinion, as it will lead to a conflict with the theme styling, and we are seeing the same cases here. Client library approach should be used for the styling which can't be achieved using theme.\n\n<@W4R5M9P4H>, <@W4SG81T9C>, <@W4XTCQ07J> Feel free to share your thoughts.\ncc : <@W4R5LUPK3>\n\n[0] - <https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-65/content/forms/getting-started/create-first-adaptive-form/style-your-adaptive-form>"

    "answer": "The customer has created a custom implementation of a character counter for text areas and text fields. The need for a character counter to show the number of characters entered by the user, and shared a GitHub link[0] provided by Adobe for the implementation.\n\nThe out-of-the-box character counter did not work well in the current scenario and a custom implementation was needed to meet the requirements.\n\nThe customer needs confirmation from Adobe to proceed with the chosen approach and help with the issue. Need confirmation on the following:\n\n1. If the CSS overlay is needed under sites with no changes. Whether to use the default CSS or create a custom one for the text input component.\n\n2. The granite.util.get method was used for localization of the character counter, but it did not work as expected. This method caused errors in the console and prevented the character counter from displaying correctly.\nAlternative Solutions: The customer tried adding granite.util to the client library for text input, but this did not resolve the issue. When the granite.util.get method was used, it resulted in an error in the console and displayed a spinner instead of the character counter. This issue needed to be resolved for proper localization, need further guidance on how to address the localization problem.\n\n3. Will this kind of feature be shipped by Adobe in the Future as a component or setting in the OOTB product?\n\n4. Backend class - forces to override certain(not all) abstract methods that you want to avoid.\n\nThe challenges faced with customizing the backend class for the character counter. The customer mentioned that extending the abstract base template, AbstractBaseImpl, AbstractFieldImpl, and implementing the text input caused issues with the multiline field and required overriding certain methods, which could lead to potential breakages during upgrades.\nThe mentioned methods needed to be overridden, which could lead to potential breakages during upgrades. This was a concern for maintaining the implementation over time. Along with that causes issues with the Multiline field. With extending abstractFieldImpl, the test class fails with NPE for the custom class. This added to the complexity of the implementation.\nAlternative Solutions: Use Lombok as an alternative to avoid overriding methods. However, Lombok was in an experimental stage and not recommended for production use, leading to further complications[1]. Need confirmation from Adobe and confirm Adobes Stand point how to proceed.\n\n[0]:<https://github.com/adobe/aem-core-forms-components/pull/1081/files>\n[1]:<https://experienceleaguecommunities.adobe.com/t5/adobe-experience-manager-blogs/aem-cloud-service-delegate-annotation-for-extending-aem-core/ba-p/586098>"

Granite Util Localization Issue:\n   - The `granite.get` function is undefined, causing errors in the console when used for localization of the character counter.\n   - Alternative solutions attempted include adding `granite.util` to the client library, but this resulted in a spinner being displayed instead of the character counter.\n   - The Granite.i18n localization is not exposed, so you can use the other way[0], which is safe to use.

Backend Class Challenges:\n   - The backend code forces overriding inherited methods.\n   - The customer explored using Lombok as an alternative but noted that it is not recommended for production use. \n   - Confirmed that certain elements need to be overridden when extending abstract classes.\n   - Highlighted safety mechanisms like versioning (e.g., V1, V2) for components to ensure stability during upgrades.\n\n3.

They can create a custom one or use the default CSS, but this folder should be present in the folder structure of the custom component.\n\n4.

Please confirm if we have fixed this issue.\n&gt; There are two POST calls -\n&gt;  <http://localhost:4502/content/dam/formsanddocuments-themes/testtheme/_jcr_content> which actually write property to dam node, so client library value is persisted.\n&gt; <http://localhost:4502/libs/fd/af/themes/gui/content/serviceMapper/setConfiguration.html> - this call actually set other configuration like dependency and this call doesn't seem to work. This seems to be broken by a security fix - <https://git.corp.adobe.com/livecycle/cq-guides/pull/5598/files> which is encoding json, so parsing of json is throwing exception, hence dependecies property is not being set on the node.

We were able to replicate the issue, and were also able to find a workaround for this problem. Action items:\n• Engineering will internally find the reason for this issue and things were running fine in the last release.\n• Workaround for this problem: Choose the appropriate configuration container `conf/global`  for the form that you are using. The customer can proceed with upgrade on stage env and test this workaround. This workaround was validated on the call on the QA env.\n• One minor feedback: The customer should not be using the global configuration container and should create a dedicated configuration container for their sites.\ncc: <@U0213T59LMN>"

    "answer": "Issue Description :\nOne of our Customers NFL has raised a concern where they are facing issues while trying to submit a form. They are having a custom submit action which is supposed to pick up the attachments from the form fields on publish and upload them into Author's DAM. To achieve this, team has written an upload API which makes a access token call(via a cloud manager API in Developer console) first to authenticate and then creates a folder and upload the assets. (code attached)\n\nCurrently, this is failing with error [0][1], though customer confirmed that it was working when instead of passing the client id and client secret to make use of cloud manager API, they had tested it using the local access token from AEM developer console.\nAs of now when adding the logic to have both ways (Cloud manager's API + Local access token), it is not working for either one.\n\nInvestigation :\nWe have confirmed with debugger at customer's local setup that the API for token generation &amp; fetch works and the generated token is fetched by the service correctly though when submitting the form, it gives a 401 unautorized and the custom submit actions returns a 500 response as well stating [1] though customer confirmed that there is no additional scripts which needs to be invoked.\n\nWhen checking the scope of cloud manager's API, below are the paramters :\nopenid, AdobeID, read_organizations, additional_info.projectedProductContext, read_pc.dma_aem_ams\n\nAuthor URL in-house :\n<https://author-p138853-e1404402.adobeaemcloud.com/content/dam/formsanddocuments/licensee-application/jcr:content?wcmmode=disabled>\n\nPublisher URL in-house :\n<https://publish-p138853-e1404402.adobeaemcloud.com/content/forms/af/licensee-application.html>\n\n[0] <http://com.adobe.aem.forms.af|com.adobe.aem.forms.af>.rest.internal.servlets.AdaptiveFormSubmitServlet Exception during form submission\njava.lang.RuntimeException: You are not authorized to submit this form.401\n\n[1]  <http://com.adobe.aem.forms.af|com.adobe.aem.forms.af>.rest.internal.servlets.AdaptiveFormCustomFunctionProviderServlet Failed to load custom functions from: , clientlib has no scripts\n\nAEM Version : 2024.11.18751.20241128T090041Z\nCore component Version : 3.0.74\n\n<https://splunk.or1.adobe.net/en-US/app/TA-aem_skyline/search?q=search%20index%3D%22dx_aem_engineering%22%20aem_service%3Dcm-p135215-e1328542%20aem_tier%3Dpublish%20level%3DERROR%20sourcetype%3Daemerror%20(%22*clientlib%20has%20no%20scripts*%22%20OR%20%22401%22)&amp;display.page.search.mode=smart&amp;dispatch.sample_ratio=1&amp;earliest=-24h%40h&amp;latest=now&amp;sid=1737599255.7797_E2F13C25-F1FF-43F3-9646-E3C74E66724E|https://splunk.or1.adobe.net/en-US/app/TA-aem_skyline/search?q=search%20index%3D%22dx_a[…]w&amp;sid=1737599255.7797_E2F13C25-F1FF-43F3-9646-E3C74E66724E>\n\nPlease advise."

However, if the disabled field was set by the dermis api using invoke service , the disabled field shows nothing.* \nEg. when numbers are keyed in and user clicks validate, on successful validation, first name last name is populated in next panel. First name and last name are disabled fields with a value say 'xxx' &amp; 'yyy'. This does not populate in DOR . Labels are shown not data. Let me know if this is expected. We need it disabled with Graying out in UI.\n2. *Customer sees a way to hide hidden fields from DOR but wants to confirm if it is doable for disabled fields.*\nUse case: If a user does not want to show disabled fields especially with issue as highlighted in #1, along with flexibility.\n3. *If we Add an onchg event to a new textfield to update a hidden field's value and disabled field's value, Customer happen's to see that the disabled field's value updates in ui however DOR only contains upto date value for hidden field and not disabled field.*\n4.*The data.json stored in sharepoint shows hidden field and not disabled field.*\nThe data.json file is stored in sharepoint when sharepoint connector is used. Customer can see that hidden field is shown and not disabled for some reason.\n5. *DOR does not contain labels that were updated via rules.*\n6. *Hidden panels are shown in DOR.*"

Or multiple ? Does it matter with splitting files across multiple upload components  in terms of performance.\n\nPlease post final metrics as this imposes restrictions without documentation\nThe business would like to gather guidelines on the size of assets and number of components to split\n\nAlso, They have Observed that with 10 files 20 mb each and a form , while 503 was thrown in n/w tab , internal error was shown on screen as an alert popup “”encountered an internal…”, after 2.2 min, an error was thrown on screen,. This shows a 503 and when user retries submission it submits fine after 2.1 min, does it save into the original folder for initial submission in sharepoint for second submit action, or does 503 actually cause persistence but empty noise(I believe this is the case due to the observation below)? The second submit the customer  reduced file attach count by 2 but yet I see the original count that makes me suspect 503 being empty noise?\nCustomer tried this approach again where I uploaded 10 files 20 mb and while 503 was shown and error was thrown to the user, the DOR and files were set behind the scenes. did not retry this time.\n\nThe customer tried submitting again with 10 files 20 mb and same form and get a new error and spinner is still showing up with no docs in sharepoint.\n\nPlease check with if splitting 10 files into 2 file upload components help?

You can refer to this guide : <https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/implementing/content-delivery/cdn-configuring-traffic|CDN Configuration Guide>.\n• When handling large payloads, the UI thread remains blocked, waiting for a response, which can take approximately 8–10 minutes to complete. The timeout setting acts as a safeguard to prevent prolonged system hang-ups. If the CDN does not receive a response from the backend within the timeout period, it disconnects from the request. However, the backend thread continues execution independently, without being linked to the UI.timed out(does not receive any response from backend thread) it detaches itself from it. Backend thread continues execution but not attached to UI anymore."

Following this, 400 Bad Request errors were served to the instance. Subsequently, the AEM Forms Output Service went down and began throwing errors. The logs indicate that the server attempts to validate a token but encounters an \"invalid token\" error, which appears to be directly related to the Output Service failure.

Given that the data includes customer PII, implementing additional security controls is essential to ensure they comply with Privacy Act.\n\nSource IP:  20.167.32.137\nUserAgent:\n[aws-sdk-java/2.22.0 Linux/6.1.96-flatcar Java_HotSpot_TM__64-Bit_Server_VM/11.0.23+7-LTS-222 Java/11.0.23 vendor/Oracle_Corporation io/sync http/Apache cfg/retry-mode/legacy]\n\n\n```$ nslookup 20.167.32.137\n*** <http://noidsibxvip01.corp.adobe.com|noidsibxvip01.corp.adobe.com> can't find 20.167.32.137: Non-existent domain\nServer:  <http://noidsibxvip01.corp.adobe.com|noidsibxvip01.corp.adobe.com>\nAddress:  10.40.4.247```\n\nAsk:\n- wanted your confirmation to check if Adobe uses TruffleHog or any bot scan ?\n- If yes, is this activity on customer's end could be legitimate?\n- If it is confirmed that these calls are indeed legitimate Adobe requests, they would plan to implement IP filtering to restrict access to specific IP ranges.\n- If no, why trufflehog would be hitting this IP (192.147.128.10)\nAlso, It is possible that this is false-positive and detected user agent is wrong (eg it is not TruffleHog).

    "answer": "This issue occurs due to the ‘clear value’ rule when the text field is cleared after selecting ‘yes’ in the radio button. Clearing the value behaves similarly to a user manually removing data from the UI, and since the field is required, the error message appears.\n\nThis is expected behavior. If you want to bypass showing the field’s validity, you can explicitly mark the field as valid. However, doing this may allow the form to be submitted without the required field being filled out."

This to them misuses the purpose of panel to contain multiple elements (or one) and forces one to wrap a single field in a panel to make use of validation .So now for a single field, that is mandatory , needs to be placed in a panel just because clear field (which to me is single field clearing) and reset panel is clearing multiple fields contained within it which can be single."

But we were not able to see the behaviour in 2023 cloud sdk versions.\n\nCould see below JS function is preventing Enter key to take action on the click event for the selected component E,g: Submit button\n\n/**\n * Prevents the default behavior of the Enter key on components within the formContainer\n * from triggering a form submission and redirecting to the Thank-You Page.\n */\n#preventDefaultSubmit(){\n    if(this._element) {\n        this._element.addEventListener('keydown', (event) =&gt; {\n            if (event.key === 'Enter') {\n                event.preventDefault();\n            }\n        });\n    }\n}\n\nIn 2023 versions [0], we could notice, that on pressing enter, we could expand the dropdown menu and collapse as well, (space can only expand)\nand also, can submit the form using enter button.\nBut in 2024 versios [1] of cloud sdk, could see, we can only expand the dropdown menu and submit the form using Space key (and not Enter).\n\nAs per <https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/FORMS-12992> (not for core component) I understand, Enter's OOTB behaviour is to submit the form when focused on an element, but currently we cannot do it in 2024 core components.\n\nThis behavior is problematic for users relying on keyboard navigation, as the \"Enter\" key is often used to activate focused elements such as buttons and dropdown menus.\n\nThe customer expects the \"Enter\" key to work similarly to the \"Space\" key, triggering click events on focused elements, aligning with standard web practices.\n\n[0] <http://10.42.32.214:4502/content/dam/formsanddocuments/dropdown/jcr:content?wcmmode=disabled>  (2023 October version)\n\n[1] <http://10.42.32.232:4504/content/dam/formsanddocuments/dropdown/jcr:content?wcmmode=disabled> (2024 July version, also tested on April version)"

The issue involves a critical failure in Adaptive form submissions and content publishing in the production environment for FirstBank Puerto Rico. Specifically, forms are getting stuck after submission, and authors are unable to publish changes in the production environment. The problem is isolated to the production environment, as staging is working fine.\n\nThe team observed cache-related log messages [0] in the error logs. Attempts were made to clear the CDN and Dispatcher cache (CSMEOPS-7346), but these did not resolve the issue.\n\nHAR indicates that no requests are initiated by form submission in prod, but works as expected/designed in stage.\n\n- Most recent deployment to prod via prod pipeline [3] [4] was performed on September 30th, Customer mentioned that this issue was initially reported at 5am Puerto Rico time (EST) the previous day, and now affects all forms on the site.\n- Customer reports that some analytics changes were made this morning, but not directly relevant to the site, they also confirmed that the same code, content and configs are working fine in stage.\n- Customer has requested that restarting the publisher to be performed but we assume, this won't help (raised SKYOPS-88239 for the same).\n-The forms submission have a POST URL endpoint on which the data gets submitted. Same endpoint is working fine in their STAGE.\n- We also tried submitting the form directly through AEM UI but same results (For author and publisher as well)\n- Could see error [1], when  trying to submit the form, On checking the network tab, there is no activity.\n-We also tried creating a new form for testing but same results with the POST URL.\n\n\n[0]\n[198.143.37.49 [1728585865938] GET /content/firstbankpuertoricoprogram/pr/es/personal/prestamo-de-auto.html HTTP/1.1] com.adobe.aem.formsndocuments.service.impl.StaleAssetIndicatorServiceImpl [StaleAssetIndicator] : Cache Stale due to dependant /conf/firstbankpuertoricoprogram/sling:configs/com.adobe.cq.wcm.core.components.internal.DataLayerConfig for asset /content/dam/formsanddocuments/simple-forms/3/pr/es/prestamo-de-auto-pr-es\n\n\n[1]\n [104.225.163.111 [1728623555046] GET /content/dam/formsanddocuments/simple-forms/3.folderthumbnail.jpg HTTP/1.1] com.day.cq.dam.core.impl.ui.preview.AbstractPreviewCreator Unable to create layer for /content/dam/formsanddocuments/simple-forms/3/pr/es/bakupprestamo-de-auto-pr-es\n\n [104.225.163.111 [1728623676545] GET /content/dam/formsanddocuments/simple-forms/3/pr/es/prestamo-de-auto-pr-es/jcr:content HTTP/1.1] com.day.cq.wcm.core.impl.reference.ContentPolicyReferenceProvider Policy under /libs won't be published: for policy path: /libs/settings/wcm/policies/wcm/foundation/components/responsivegrid/afpolicy, and for resource path: /conf/firstbankpuertoricoprogram/settings/wcm/templates/blank-af\n\n[2] <https://splunk.or1.adobe.net/en-GB/app/TA-AMS_ui/search?q=search%20index%3D%22dx_aem_en[…]&sid=1728624851.70693_75E8025B-8CA1-4E53-B9F1-31FCB54511E1>\n\n[3] <https://aemcs-workspace.adobe.com/customer/program/64062#pipelineExecutions>\n\n[4] <https://aemcs-workspace.adobe.com/customer/program/64062/pipeline/11981732/execution/4770037>"

After the update the location of the call is correctly rewritten with the \"resource.resolver.mapping\" rule, however the \"aemFormComponentPath\" and \"afSuccessRedirectUrl\" are not rewritten: this causes the call to fail and the customer is requesting if we could fix the rewrites as well.\n\nRequesting your inputs on this.\n\nThanks\nPranay"

Are you interacting with the APIs or directly invoking the OutputService (OSGi service)?\nWe are directly invoking the OSGI service, yes.\n\n2.  Regarding the first run, we noticed a few failures at the OutputService within a specific one-minute window, indicating that the native container was not available to serve the traffic. These could be due to scaling kicking in for the pods to handle the burst. After that, the system handled the increased load as expected (we didn’t see many errors after that).\nYes, correct. All the errors were noticed during a 2-3 minute window at the start of the test.\n\n3. Apart from this, we also see several failures in the client's custom servlet resulting in 400 errors. Can you please check these on your end?\nThis is expected error logging during the schema validation failure during initial xml parsing if any non-mandatory element is missing. However, these are logged as errors for reporting and no exception is thrown(400 or otherwise).\n\n4. Based on the numbers from November 8th that you shared, there are just two 5xx responses out of 30,412 requests, which equates to a 0.006% error rate. This should be well within the acceptable limit.

We are not sure exactly which errors are reported as 400.\n• We are aware of 500s during instantaneous scaling from cold start (initial state) or very low replicas onwards. This phenomenon also subsides when system has scaled to a larger replica set. Regarding this, you need to define burst load parameters for us - how many req/s so that we can investigate and check internally whether/what we can do to support your use-case.\n• How is burst traffic being generated? These requests are either generated by external users outside customer’s control or by some process owned by the customer.\n• As <@W9QMZFR39> mentioned before, we already support 120K requests per hr, 100K/couple of hours should work as well.\n• I checked the splunk logs but was unable to find either 409 or 429 errors.

There are two standing pods always but as the load increases additional pods are spun up to handle it. There may be a warmup delay for the new pod to be active. The customer should increase the load gradually to align with the autoscaling. Does burst traffic being generated using LoadRunner tool mimic actual traffic?\ncc: <@U038XFD63GS>"

We tried logging into the incognito mode and we were able to see the Create Adaptive Form button, but on refreshing the page the button is not visible.\n3. For some users, the button is working on the VPN, and for a few customers not. Again on refreshing the button is not visible.\nWhen the button is not available, we are not able to edit the form as well and also not able to preview the form as HTML as well.\n\nThe issue is the same across all the 3 environments. Please refer to the Splunk logs during that time.\n\nThis is a very High Priority issue as the customer is not able to create the form and they have their timelines impacted due to this.\n\ncc: <@W4R5LUPK3>"

    "answer": "Investors Group have set up AEM Forms integration with Analytics and Launch. The integration is set up separately for each of these products. The Analytics integration is working and they see data now in Workspace (pulling the props and events set up in AEM). The Launch integration was also done in AEM. In addition to the configuration changes done in AEM, in Launch, the AEM Form extension is added in the property. There is a custom event that should fire when the form is submitted using the documentation:\n<https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-65/content/forms/integrate-aem-forms-with-experience-cloud-solutions/integrate-aem-forms-with-adobe-analytics>\n\nOn one of the forms where the AEM Forms integration with Launch has been set up and on submitting the form, Using the Adobe Debugger we can see the Analytics integration props and events firing. For the custom event (Rule) set up in Launch that should fire on form submit,  with the Rule to set some evars and props and an event. We do not see this data in the debugger, as suspected the rule isn't firing.\n\nRequesting your input on this.\n\nBelow are the URL's of the customer.\n\n<https://www.ig.ca/en/why-ig/tax>\n<https://www.ig.ca/en/why-ig/tax-help>\n<https://www.ig.ca/en/why-ig/upgrade>\n<https://www.ig.ca/en/why-ig/second-opinion>\n<https://www.ig.ca/en/why-ig/retirement>\n<https://www.ig.ca/en/why-ig/retirement-plan>\n\nThis is the first time they are doing this &amp; it is impacting their campaign that is starting soon."

I can set up a call with the customer. The customer is now available.\n\nAlso, I discussed the issue with Tier 3 Analytics <@W88ULESBB>.\n\nFeedback from Analytics Tier 3: I think the issue here is that the AEM team created an extension in the launch. There is no support team at adobe that supports Launch Extensions. The closest would be the product team, so in this case, it'd be the AEM support team that supports how the AEM launch extension functions. The AEM launch extension has a dropdown that just says, \"fire launch rules with 'Event Type:Submit' occurs\" . launch rule is either not happening because\n(1) 'Event Type: Submit' is not firing, therefore the launch rule doesn't fire or 'Event Type: Submit' fires, but\n(2) the launch javascript listening for it doesn't run because the page navigates away before the javascript can complete, or\n(3) There's an issue with AEM where either the configuration isn't triggering the correct form submit that launch is listening for, or\n4) it's all broken on the AEM side of things and this is the only customer that has reported it\n\nIf the AEM product team could let us know how to trigger the javascript event that this is specifically listening for then we could probably pinpoint the issue"

    "answer": "Firefox often retains form data across page reloads if it has been filled out previously. This is because Firefox tends to store the input values in its cache.\n\nSince this is browser specific behavior, you can use attributes like `autocomplete=\"off\"` to disable this behavior in firefox, but  `autocomplete` attribute itself does not directly apply to some form elements like checkboxes and radio buttons. For other components, we have this support in the component edit dialog. I have disabled `autocomplete` for other fields in the form shared and the data is not retained"

    "answer": "In foundation forms, the `autocomplete` attribute is set to “off” at the container level. As a result, autocomplete is disabled for all fields within that form, overriding any individual field settings.\n\nTherefore, even if autocomplete is enabled on individual fields, it will not function. Hence, in core component, we don’t add this attribute by default.\n\nSince core components are easily customizable, one can create a custom form container component with these settings as per their use-case"

    "answer": "There should be a tooltip when they hover over the button. Just by looking at the picture it seems the go-live date is probably in the past, and assume that's why the button is disabled.\nIf the go-live date is in the past you can't update the program to use that date. You can also mark the go-live as complete and then it shouldn't matter for updating the program.\nUsually whenever we disable a button we have a tooltip as well that explains why it's disabled.\nOn the update button when disabled we do not see any tooltip\nsuggest running a pipeline in order for the solutions to be applied to the environments, since those only get updated when a deployment happens.\nCustomer was able to internally resolve the issue"

When the customer use It directly in their code, it is not working as expectedly.\nThe customer tried to modify some of this code but some issues are still there.\n\n*So, The customer wanted to check if they need to modify this react code or is there any other approach/code available?* \n\nLooks like there is headless form also available but when the customer create it using latest archetype and drag and drop the Form components on SPA page, they are not working.\nSo, is there additional code required to integrate adaptive forms with react SPA editor? The customer is under an impression that headless forms are supported by Adobe and react SPA is also supported by Adobe, so there should be a smooth integration available out of box."

    "answer": "```As discussed over the call, you had some issues related to merging React projects with AEM Forms, highlighting problems with rendering components, and embedding forms into React SPA pages. \nCurrently, the documentation is pointing to the react repo concerning AEM Forms 6.4. We have a newer approach, the current approach that you are currently using, you are rendering the whole form from the server and amending it as the whole HTML, and with this approach, you will not be able to use the spa editor to kind of drag, drop and create the form there itself so.\nSo with the introduction of headless adaptive forms, there are two approaches that we can follow. If you're authoring the form within the site page, then you'll be able to drag and drop the competence there itself. There is a PR that you may have to just check if currently you are using out-of-the-box core components or custom components.\nSo with this merge on a page itself, we would be able to drag and drop these core components right for SP. You'll have to integrate the changes because you have already created a page, so you'll have to integrate one time. \nAs discussed, this PR[0] is still a work in progress and we trying to get this merged as soon as possible but we do not have a fixed timeline on the same.\nAs for the suggestions and the approaches that we discussed over the call, please drop an email at <mailto:tanvia@adobe.com|tanvia@adobe.com>, we would be happy to help and keep you posted.\n[0]:<https://github.com/adobe/react-starter-kit-aem-headless-forms/blob/main/src/Form.tsx>```"

    "answer": "When the customer try to POST a date value then the output is converted to T00 format as shown in screenshot. And on same request we do a get call we receive the same value as output. These results are from the test service FDM.\n\nNow the customer has created an adaptive and mapped the FDM to the Form, when the date input are submitted along with form submission. Then in network logs we see the correct date format as we typed.\nAlso, when we see behind the scenes in the logs, printing the value we get the correct format.\nPost submission when the customer go back to test service on FDM and do a get call the response received is again converted into T04 format.\n\nNow the customer would like to understand why there are multiple conversion in the date format. How these conversions are handles and which services and submission cause which kind of conversion or is this conversion is actually because of the AEM Forms.\nAlso, is conversion on submit or when storing the data to database."

    "answer": "Hi <@U02RMEY3D1C>,\nUpdating to the latest core components has indeed helped with updating the labels. However, the customer has further queries regarding the updated label.\n\n1. *Updating the Panel Name:* Instead of updating the field inside the panel, the customer wants to update the panel itself. I attempted to modify the function to update the panel name directly, but it did not work. Below is the function I used:\nJavaScript fxn:\n```/**\n * updatePanelLabel\n * @name updatePanelLabel\n * @param {object} repeatablePanel\n * @param {scope} globals\n */\nfunction updatePanelLabel(repeatablePanel, globals) {\n  var repeatedPanel = globals.form.repeat_panel;\n  var labelValue = 'Testing ' + repeatedPanel.length;\n  // console.log(\"Length \" + repeatedPanel.length);\n  // globals.functions.setProperty(repeatedPanel[repeatedPanel.length-1].who_lives_name,{label : {\"value\" : labelValue}});\n  globals.functions.setProperty(repeatedPanel[repeatedPanel.length-1], {label: {\"value\": labelValue}});\n}```\n\n2.  *Using the Rule Editor:* The customer has asked if it is possible to achieve this use case via the rule editor instead of using scripts. Is there any workaround that can be implemented using the rule editor to update the panel label without involving scripts?\n\nCould you please share some insights on these matters?"

When data is submitted then all the children data would be submitted (array of objects, in case its json schema based form, XML elements in case its XFA or XSD based form), in'bound' section of submitted data.

In the meantime, you can use custom functions to achieve similar results.\nAs discussed Form can only be configured to have one submit action that is, either it would be FDM submit or email submit. Alternatively you can use a custom submit button or a workflow to do multiple things.\nAs discussed, accordinging to your use case using custom submit Button would be a better approach. Also, as for multiple invoke, it will trigger all the invoked."

Currently, they are able to use the attached rules on a button and populate the Dropdown List after manually clicking the button. They would want to achieve dynamically populating the dropdown when form is previewed. Customer has also advised it used to work previously in older versions using \"Set Options Of\" event of the DropDown but this is not available now.\n\nQueries raised by the customer:\n\n1. Can we replicate something like set options of old form version with \"set output of function\" or \"invoke service\" to set enums and enumnames?\n2. Can we populate without submit if we need to set output of function output in 2 hidden text fields as comma separated for enums and enumnames?\nor if there is any further alternative."

    "answer": "Hi <@W4R5M9P4H> customer has raised a few queries on the approach suggested to dynamically populate the dropdowns.\n\n1. \"Does Adobe plan to bring setOptions on DropDown for core components?\"\n- This comes from the information mentioned in article [1] we mention \"Rule Editor in Core Components does not support the Set Options of property to set the dropdown list options at runtime. However, you can set the dropdown list options using custom functions.\"\n\n[1] <https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/forms/adaptive-forms-authoring/authoring-adaptive-forms-core-components/create-an-adaptive-form-on-forms-cs/create-and-use-custom-function-core-component/custom-function-core-components-use-cases#set-the-dropdown-list-options-using-custom-functions>\n\n2. In case no, the approach listed under [2] is a very roundabout approach for customer's use.\n- If there is an Service that you're invoking, you will have to set the response of 'enums' and 'enum' and 'enum names' in two different hidden fields, parse them to add comma separated values (if that is the case) and initialize them on DropDown. Additionally, this will need to be done for every dropdown.(e.g we have 10 dropdowns in the form, we need hidden fields for all of them)\n- Additionally, there might be race condition involved with this approach. If you have an invoke service and you're doing a drop down on initialize, the Dropdown might look for the values. If the invoke Service takes some time to retrieve the data, there's gonna be a lot of custom approaches that need to be involved in order to populate this initializing of the drop down.\n\n[2]\n<https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/forms/adaptive-forms-authoring/authoring-adaptive-forms-core-components/create-an-adaptive-form-on-forms-cs/create-and-use-custom-function-core-component/custom-function-core-components-use-cases#set-the-dropdown-list-options-using-custom-functions>\n\n3. While checking this issue, we also saw that if we try to 'Set Value Of' of a text input field to a Service Output, we see the attached message (attached).\n\nPlease let me know if you need any further details on this or if we can setup a call to understand customer's use case better.\n\n<http://10.42.42.40:4502/editor.html/content/forms/af/testingdropdown.html>"

(Refer - timeout.txt).\n\nThey are using code same as the core form handler\n\n<https://github.com/adobe/aem-core-wcm-components/blob/main/bundles/core/src/main/java/com/adobe/cq/wcm/core/components/internal/form/FormHandlerImpl.java>\n\nAlso,\nThey have a retry mechanism (up to 3 times) in place, so if they get timeout, They do retry which succeeds.\nSo, for the following submission they had successful submission, just that they see read timeout which increases total time.\n\n*Request Log:*\n\n```18/Jun/2024: 38 +0000 [33599] -> POST /adobe/forms/af/submit/L2NvbnRlbnQvZm9ybXMvYWYvZW4vcHVibGljL2ZpbmFuY2lhbC1zZXJ2aWNlcy9mcy03NC11b2EtbmV3LWV4YW1pbmVyLW9yLXJlYWN0aXZhdGlvbi1mb3Jt HTTP/1.1 [cm-p110704-e1133840-aem-publish-67f4bff864-2wplq]\n\n18/Jun/2024: 01:02 +0000 [33599] <- 200 application/json 23735ms [cm-p110704-e1133840-aem-publish-67f4bff864-2wplq]```\n*CDN:*\n\n```Line 2369231: {\"timestamp\":\"2024-06-18T00:00:38+0000\",\"ttfb\":23772,\"cli_ip\":\"103.21.175.194\",\"cli_country\":\"NZ\",\"rid\":\"a0af351f-26ac-42ed-8921-9eac77c648e7\",\"req_ua\":\"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/115.0\",\"host\":\"www.forms.cloud.dev2.auckland.ac.nz\",\"url\":\"/adobe/forms/af/submit/L2NvbnRlbnQvZm9ybXMvYWYvZW4vcHVibGljL2ZpbmFuY2lhbC1zZXJ2aWNlcy9mcy03NC11b2EtbmV3LWV4YW1pbmVyLW9yLXJlYWN0aXZhdGlvbi1mb3Jt\",\"method\":\"POST\",\"res_ctype\":\"application/json\",\"cache\":\"PASS\",\"debug\":\"\",\"res_age\":\"\",\"status\":200,\"pop\":\"AKL\",\"rules\":\"\",\"alerts\":\"\",\"sample\":\"\"}```\nSo, for Above Request\n\n1) First Post Call Got timed out after 10 seconds, which API layer confirmed they didn't receive any request, so no duplicate record.\n2) Retry Post call succeeded\n3) 200 status is returned to user\n\nTotal time taken = 23 seconds, due to 10 seconds timeout\n\n\n*Ask :*\n \na)Is there any configuration that needs to be taken care of ?\n\nb)Do they need to set\nPoolingHttpClientConnectionManager configuration for maxTotal, DefaultMaxPerRoute and yes what's recommended values for these properties.\n\n\n```PoolingHttpClientConnectionManager clientConnectionManager = new PoolingHttpClientConnectionManager();\nclientConnectionManager.setDefaultMaxPerRoute(5);\nclientConnectionManager.setMaxTotal(25);```"

There is no configuration required on author or publish for form submission on publish to trigger workflow on author.  When form submission happens on publish, the form data would be posted from the client to a submission API on publish which would send the data to author for workflow processing.

If the sharepoint list has more than 999 entries and the form includes an attachment, then the form submission fails.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1) Have over 999 records in a sharepoint list\n2) Submit a form to insert a new record that includes attachments\n3) The new record with id 1000 is created in sharepoint\n4) Then the attachment tries to attach to the record but uses id 1,000 instead of id 1000\n5) Attachment fails to be added to sharepoint list\n6) AEM form shows user a submission failed prompt\n\nHTTP response from step 4.

The job will be picked up asynchronously to execute the steps consecutively.\n2. I am not sure I understood the question correctly. There is no configuration required on author or publish. No configuration needs to go through vsts/codebase. If the concern is about form data - when form submission happens on publish, the form data would be posted from the client to a submission API on publish which would send the data to author for workflow processing. No form data is stored on publish during form submission. We can also avoid storing form data on author using external persistence of workflow data.

    "answer": "Call Summary:\n\n```As discussed over the call, in the use case that you have and trying to implement, you have multiple PUTS that you need to incorporate in AEM Forms as a Cloud service.\nIn case of multiple PUTS and having different tables in circular reference, only one of those would be updated.\nNow use the case we have multiple ways:\n\n1) Workflows\n\nWith workflows, There's one piece where communication to the front end would be an asynchronous thing. The communication to the front end to display any sort of errors would be the main thing. Along with send email functionality which would have to be customized according to the use case. You can use different email templates which would create more placeholders and start showing in the send email component.\n\nAs for the workflow part, you have concerns about the performance of the workflows.\n\nWorkflows run asynchronously and there you would get a notification that the workflow is triggered, but the actual step execution can happen with a delay.\nThe delay will be in milliseconds, but it also depends on the load or how many workflows you are trying to trigger per second which will translate to how many Forms submissions you are trying to do.\n\nSo, as discussed we would require an approximate idea of the load that is going to come. Also, this would be impacted on the dynamics data and their environment which we would need from dynamics teams. Also, this dynamics latency would be better answered by dynamics teams. \nThe dynamics instance the region where the service is located and where AEM is located, all would add to you know the performance.\n\nWorkflow execution happens asynchronously like there are multiple steps, some of them run in a single thread until it find a participant step/decision-making step.\nBased on the information shared and shown, the performance of this particular Workflow would be limited by the number of put calls that you are making. Performance-wise that is not going to be a big difference unless there are a large number of Forms submissions and there is a huge number of workflows being so executed and they all have to run. So we'll be limited by the number of threads that can run.\n\nSo with your workflows with a large number of users or a large number of Forms submissions, we could have some performance issues. Plus there is an additional call that is going from the publish instance to the author and so there is that round trip time right for that. Plus workload answers synchronously, so you'll not catch your errors. Also, Workflow stores all the information within the AEM instance. So if you have PII data, we suggest that that data goes to an external database that is a customer's own database.\nSo, there are these concerns with using workflows.\n\n2) To run multiple invoke services on the submit action item. But for this, you will require a custom error handler. You tested the same at your end and was working. As of now, there are some issues with the invoked service in the latest version that would need to be looked into.\n\n3) Using Guidelib \n\nAs discussed, that is not the recommended approach because of submission capabilities. When you use one of the submit actions of the form right, like sending email or invoking form data or any of these. There are multiple things that you get like server-side validation of the form and then captcha integration. You will not be able to dark those capabilities. All these things are coming along with the submit action and you will miss out on these things when you use the guide Lib functions.\n\n4) Using a Custom Submit button\n\nAs discussed, you need more information on this way to have a custom submit button with FDM. \nSo, as mentioned we will Share public documentation and samples for FDM API to facilitate custom submit action development. The engineering team is looking into that and will share the same with you shortly.\nAs discussed this would be one of the best options for this use case.```"

    "answer": "The summary of the ticket and resolution:\n\n```As discussed over the call, in the use case that you have and trying to implement, you have multiple PUTS that you need to incorporate in AEM Forms as a Cloud service.\nIn case of multiple PUTS and having different tables in circular reference, only one of those would be updated.\nNow use the case we have multiple ways:\n\n1) Workflows\n\nWith workflows, There's one piece where communication to the front end would be an asynchronous thing. The communication to the front end to display any sort of errors would be the main thing. Along with send email functionality which would have to be customized according to the use case. You can use different email templates which would create more placeholders and start showing in the send email component.\n\nAs for the workflow part, you have concerns about the performance of the workflows.\n\nWorkflows run asynchronously and there you would get a notification that the workflow is triggered, but the actual step execution can happen with a delay.\nThe delay will be in milliseconds, but it also depends on the load or how many workflows you are trying to trigger per second which will translate to how many Forms submissions you are trying to do.\n\nSo, as discussed we would require an approximate idea of the load that is going to come. Also, this would be impacted on the dynamics data and their environment which we would need from dynamics teams. Also, this dynamics latency would be better answered by dynamics teams. \nThe dynamics instance the region where the service is located and where AEM is located, all would add to you know the performance.\n\nWorkflow execution happens asynchronously like there are multiple steps, some of them run in a single thread until it find a participant step/decision-making step.\nBased on the information shared and shown, the performance of this particular Workflow would be limited by the number of put calls that you are making. Performance-wise that is not going to be a big difference unless there are a large number of Forms submissions and there is a huge number of workflows being so executed and they all have to run. So we'll be limited by the number of threads that can run.\n\nSo with your workflows with a large number of users or a large number of Forms submissions, we could have some performance issues. Plus there is an additional call that is going from the publish instance to the author and so there is that round trip time right for that. Plus workload answers synchronously, so you'll not catch your errors. Also, Workflow stores all the information within the AEM instance. So if you have PII data, we suggest that that data goes to an external database that is a customer's own database.\nSo, there are these concerns with using workflows.\n\n2) To run multiple invoke services on the submit action item. But for this, you will require a custom error handler. You tested the same at your end and was working. As of now, there are some issues with the invoked service in the latest version that would need to be looked into.\n\n3) Using Guidelib \n\nAs discussed, that is not the recommended approach because of submission capabilities. When you use one of the submit actions of the form right, like sending email or invoking form data or any of these. There are multiple things that you get like server-side validation of the form and then captcha integration. You will not be able to dark those capabilities. All these things are coming along with the submit action and you will miss out on these things when you use the guide Lib functions.\n\n4) Using a Custom Submit button\n\nAs discussed, you need more information on this way to have a custom submit button with FDM. \nSo, as mentioned we will Share public documentation and samples for FDM API to facilitate custom submit action development. The engineering team is looking into that and will share the same with you shortly.\nAs discussed this would be one of the best options for this use case.\n\nBased on the discussion, Using a Custom Submit button would be one the best approach according to your use case that you have shared as engineering suggested over the call.\nCustom Submit documentation is here[0] and  Dermis Bridge api details are documentated here[1].\nI am attaching a sample for your reference to help you with the implementation and Dermis API calls. This is just a sample that we can provide you to go through with the use case and implementation. You will have to make the necessary changes according to your specific use case and implementation.\n[0]:<https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/forms/[…]tions-and-metadata-submission/custom-submit-action-form>\n[1]:<https://javadoc.io/static/com.adobe.aem/aem-forms-sdk-api/2021.11.18.00/com/adobe/aem/dermis/api/bridge/IDermisBridge.html>\n\nyou can use this method[0] as an alternative, which takes IValueMap instead of JSONObject(deprecated).\n[0] : <https://javadoc.io/static/com.adobe.aem/aem-forms-sdk-api/2021.11.18.00/com/adobe/aem/dermis/api/bridge/OperationOptions.html#%3Cinit%3[…]IValueMap>)\n\nthe error[0] is due to the jsonObjectToValue method. The IvalueMap function would work, however this test case will fail. To address the same we have logged a Jira FORMS-15623 with engineering team. As of now, in case this test case is causing high concerns, you can use JsonObject library for temporary use case and then once the fix is available can use the IValueMap.\n\n[0]:java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/adobe/aem/dermis/api/util/JsonUtils\n\tat com.adobe.aem.dermis.util.ValueUtil.jsonObjectToValue(ValueUtil.java:502)```"

    "answer": "[Update]\n\n<@W9QMZFR39> and <@U038XFD63GS>,\nThank you for providing your insights and guidance to resolve this issue.\n\nI had a connect with customer and they are good with the resolution provided.\n\n*Following were the pointers which helped us resolve this issue :*\n• It is very important to understand that when calling outputService.generatePDFOutput(), it is very crucial to set the ContentRoot correctly as using this content root our fragments are resolved and not the relative referencing path given in main xdp for barcode. Therefore, always set the top level directory as your contentRoot (all your main XDP/XDP folder and fragment/ fragment folder is down the heirarchy). Resourceresolve sets a lock at the contentRoot and if your fragment folder is up the heirarchy than contentRoot, it would not be able to resolve it. Refer sample code attached. \n• Refrain from setting up absolute path say (\\content\\dam\\formsanddocuments\\fragments\\xdp\\barcode.xdp) as referencing path in the main XDP. Also refrain from giving relative path with resepect to main XDP as folders on the upper level say (../../barcode.xdp)\n• Provide the referencing path in the main XDP relative to your contentRoot. Ex : if your contentRoot is set as (/content/dam/formsanddocuments/af-personal/) and say your barcode is present at (/content/dam/formsanddocuments/af-personal/fragments/barcode.xdp) then provide the referencing path in main XDP as (./fragments/barcode.xdp). Given like this, when it comes to resolving the barcode.xdp fragment it would form a complete path as (/content/dam/formsanddocuments/af-personal/./fragments/barcode.xdp)\n• when calling the method outputService.generatePDFOutput(templateName, data, options), give templateName as full path of your main XDP (\"crx:///content/dam/formsanddocuments/af-personal/main-xdps/CM201-0822.xdp\"). If only name of XDP given, it would go under the folder where you have set the contentRoot to find the main XDP. \n• Another interesting thing which helped us resolve this issue is the SOM expression check which happens in Designer for each fragment. Go to Designer > click on fragment > check the name of fragment > check som expression in custom > it should be \"$template.form1.barcode\", if it is not this, the resolutions would not happen. \nAs suggested, I have logged a JIRA for keeping a documented record.\n<https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/FORMS-15100>\n\nMarking this as resolved for now.\n\ncc : <@W4WF2PALU>"

Customer modified that to use formdata which was a string from the inputstream and got the bytes array from there to generate the XML which worked for them \n• Followed engineering suggestion to resolve the referenced image as well\n• They were having issues with Docker setup, when deployed the code to cloud instance, it worked like a charm "

The highlighted service users [aflac-service-user-service] is not able to find the workflow workitem or resourceResolver as mentioned in code snippet below :\n\n• They have created service user aflac-service-user-service with forced path system/cq:services\n• They have set principal ACL for aflac-service-user-service\n     allow jcr:all on /\n     allow jcr:all on /var\n     allow jcr:all on /var/workflow/instances\n     allow jcr:all on /content/dam\n\nBut it is not working for them.\nPlease advise"

    "answer": "<@U0560NJH5SP>, How is the code trying to find the workitem? Is it using the workflowSession.getWorkItem(&lt;workItemId&gt;)?\n\nIf so, there is an additional access check that checks if the current user is the assignee of the workitem or belongs to the assignee group. So, if the service user is not the assignee or part of the assignee group, then it wont be able to access the workitem.\n\nIs there a constraint on accessing the workitem using the assignee resource resolver?\n\nOne option could be to add the service user as a super user in the OSGi config Adobe Granite Workflow Service. But it requires evaluation as to whether you need to add this service user as a super user and bypass these kinds of checks.\n\nAlso, you will need to provide jcr:read on /var/workflow/models as well"

    "answer": "<@U02REKT1JAY>, The following are findings of the investigation.\n*Observations :*\n1. Created a fresh template using core component af template type - *Core Component AF Template*.\n2. Created a form using this template - Form creation is successful (Later disabled the template)\n3. Tried to create a form using template - *University of Auckland Form*\n4. Form creation fails with exception - `Property is protected: jcr:uuid = 09e0d6be-f619-4405-b021-27eb1c5326d3`\nThe error message indicates that template initial content is using `jcr:uuid` property with value `09e0d6be-f619-4405-b021-27eb1c5326d3`   In the system, there can be only unique values for uuid property. During form creation, when template initial content is being copied, it fails due to presence of already used uuid. A template initial content shouldn't have any `jcr:uuid` property, since during form creation, initial content is copied. In the current case, it seems that the template initial content has been modified by copying node from any existing form which have the jcr:uuid value `09e0d6be-f619-4405-b021-27eb1c5326d3` already. To fix this issue, ask customer to remove this uuid from template initial content source (.content.xml) file.\n\ncc : <@W4XTCQ07J>"

    "answer": "Customer has raised the below queries with us after being impacted by previous 15977 release which was roll-backed:\n\n1. Customer has a Go-Live planned for May 28th\n\nThey want to avoid any surprises and issues on our environments from Adobe Maintenance Release and Feature Release planned for May 27-29, and May 30th. They want to pause their instance with program \"p115977\".\n- I have raised <https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/SKYOPS-77879> for this ask. Please do let me know if additional approvals are needed for the same.\n\n2. They want the releases paused until Adobe can establish a process for rolling out releases in dev and test environments, give them 2 weeks to perform testing and then deploy to stage and PROD.\n\n3. Customer wanted to know if the releases could be rolled out to DEV/TEST environments first or if they can do their validations on Stage before they approve releases for PROD.\n- I raised this internally and found the below answers:\na. Update process is fully automated – there are no manual approvals required or available and moving to group 30/40 won't help with this. See: <https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/implementing/deploying/aem-version-updates#ci-cd>\nb. Releases goes automatically. Usually at the same day for dev, then stage, then prod. No need to manage Update button anymore but DEV instances can be updated automatically EARLIER (on the same day the release is available; no need to click Update button) – this is possible if we move Customer to special groups 30/40.\n\n- Customer has raised a follow-up query on what these groups are and how can they be enrolled in it.\n\nPlease let me know your feedback on these queries raised."

If the user uses the widget , the pop-up calendar widget shows date as well while format needed is month and year only.*\n *3. The widget look and feel wise changes to an HTML type widget.* \n*4. The value persisted is of the expected format eg May/2001 but the data sent is with the date since calendar widget forces user to select date.* \n \n*Architectural stack:*\n AEMFaaCS 2024.4\n Core component version : 3.0.24\n\n *Reproducible environment :*\n *<http://10.42.40.194:4502/editor.html/content/forms/af/test_dates_core.html>*\n \n *Investigation so far :*\nAll of the issues are replicable on in-house instance when we try to add custom date patterns say MMMM/y.\n\nRequesting your kind inputs on the same.

    "answer": "Our customer \"*HDI AG*\" reporting an issue that adaptive form submissions fails intermittently because of prolonged DoR generation.\nCustomer is facing this in PROD and DEV server and they were able to replicate this issue in DEV server with a simple AF of one field.\n\nThe custom submit action logic:\n- it generates and sends an email with DoR, attachments *and JSON data* to an email address polled by some automation tools of HDI.\n- then, it delegates the creation and sending of another email (to the person submitting the form) to the default Email Submission Action.\n\n# Expected behavior\nOnce a user clicks \"submit\" the submission process is handled promptly and returns a success message to the user.\n\n# Actual behavior\nOnce a user clicks \"submit\", intermittently the submission process takes a very long time, resulting in a timeout for the client. The user does not get any success message and thus re-sends the form . This results in the same data being submitted twice or even more.\n\n# Business impact\nThe impact is two-fold. On the business-side (HDI) it is a huge effort to determine if a submission has been sent twice, as the sent email automatically starts a number of business processes with other systems.\nOn the client-side, customers, although they have clicked on the \"submit\" button are being returned to the Adaptive Form without any message (neither success or failure). This is a bad look for HDI, as the process to fill in and submit forms is one of the key touch points of the customer experience, where trust and reliability of HDI is of utmost importance.\n\n# Initial analysis\nAs the issue occurs intermittently, it is hard to reproduce. customer were able to isolate one occurrence in a recent logfile though, where rendering of a minimal DoR (just one text field) took 120256 milliseconds. It is attached to the issue.\nAlso attached is another excerpt, where you can see that the same form and DoR usually takes much less time during rendering (e.g. 332, 5230, 419 ms)\n\nCustomer's AEM forms version :2024.4.15860.20240410T113939Z\nDEV env (where issue is reproducible):<https://author-p69952-e617152.adobeaemcloud.com/ui#/aem/aem/formdetails.html/content/dam/formsanddocuments/eggs-test/email-submission-test?appId=aemshell>\n\nPFA the logs.\n\nAny inputs on this?"

It blocks the thread to run concurrently as AEM can allow multiple workflow threads to run concurrently. By default the number of threads is configured to be half the number of processor cores on the system.\n\nExample # 2\nThey also tried to suspend the workflow before Thread.Wait() and resume the workflow once they have status change but it creates the same problem. Only difference is the status of the Workflow gets change to SUSPENDED.\n\n\nThe customer has thought of a workaround to suspend the workflow and resume based on adobe sign webbhook but their workflow would go to suspended state which will not mimic out of box \"Sign Document\" component, but they need help on how this can be implemented.\n\nBelow is the call recording with customer for more details on the issue:\n<https://adobe-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/p/rahulpandey/ERBD3DEcDopCtZ2QEjUT7TgByycVuoBHl5h4cxmsevoALw?e=DSl7Tq>\n\n\nBelow are the customer's instance details..\nAEM Release : 2024.4.15860.20240410T113939Z\nAuthor url : <https://author-p60469-e738775.adobeaemcloud.com>\nProgram ID : p60469"

After this change, the deployment pipelines have started failing. The customer has provided logs indicating that removing form code and instances from CRX/DE did not resolve the issue, and they have requested a solution as soon as possible.\nInvestigation and Analysis\nSupport has reviewed the logs and has asked the customer to perform steps shared by the support team. A meeting was scheduled to discuss the issue in more detail. The support team has recognized the large impact of the issue on the customer's deployment processes and has indicated the involvement of product engineering team members if necessary.\nSupport has ensured that below steps has been performed :\n1\\. Delete from AEM Codebase: All Forms artifacts & Forms Folders from CRX & remove the following folder structures from CRX in the DEV environment after taking a snapshot of the instance :\nformsanddocuments\nformsanddocuments-fdm\nformsanddocuments-themes\n2\\. Run Pipeline and check if we have any references for forms\nLet us know if there is any issue. then :\n3\\. Enable Forms\n4\\. Run Pipeline so that all changes are deployed, without thier forms code\n5\\. Redeploy their custom code base via pipeline / crx packagemanger\nHowever it fails before step 4 completes.\nWe have ensured all forms code and packages been removed from customer code or package manager as confirmed by them, they dont see any traces of forms components, still it fails at step 4.\nLogs show no particular ERROR indicating the Root Cause.\nBuild Logs Are attached for both Success and Failure Scenarios.\nFind The Splunk Log Details:\n<https://splunk.or1.adobe.net/en-US/app/TA-aem_skyline/search?earliest=-15m%40m&latest=now&q=search%20index%3D%22dx_aem_engineering%22%20aem_service%3Dcm-p92656-e836304%20aem_tier%20IN%20(author)%20level%3DERROR%20&display.page.search.mode=verbose&dispatch.sample_ratio=1&display.page.search.tab=events&sid=1670827408.106514_89D2A891-A57C-4842-88B4-B457CCFD3156|https://splunk.or1.adobe.net/en-US/app/TA-aem_skyline/search?earliest=-15m%40m&latest=n[…]sid=1670827408.106514_89D2A891-A57C-4842-88B4-B457CCFD3156>\nCustomer Impact\nThe failing deployment pipelines are a significant issue, causing a blockage in all deployments, which is impacting the customer's ability to perform critical updates to their environment.\nNext Steps\nFurther investigation is required to identify the root cause of the pipeline failures post enabling of the AEM Forms add-on. The customer's logs and additional information from the investigation conducted by support will be crucial to troubleshooting the issue.\nAdditional Information\nCustomer DEV URL : Dev author url: <https://author-p92656-e836304.adobeaemcloud.com/libs/granite/core/content/login.html>\nFull investigation available here: <https://aemcs-workspace.adobe.com/bot/dynamics/investigation/b255cdc8-6029-4fd6-96b4-7b03c2f1e110>"

    "answer": "Hi Team,\n\nOne of our customer Deloitte, has recently raised an issue with the AEM Forms as a cloud service environment. According to the customer, they are trying to create an adaptive form and saving it in a different location. When they are trying to save the form is a different location they are not able to view the \"Select Folder\" and \"Cancel\" button if the resolution of browser is set to 100%.\n\nHowever if they reduce the resolution of the browser from 100% to 75% they can see both the buttons on the page. The customer mentioned that the behavior might be different for different browsers, but they wanted to see if we can implement a scroll bar incase the buttons are not visible due to the browser resolution."

Sites editor library is causing the issue while opening form editor. If we remove the custom hook client library (*/apps/csh-aem-core/clientlibs/clientlib-authoring*), it will fix the issue.

Hidden components are working fine (not getting displayed) while preview the form seperately, but when the same form is used in pages, the hidden field logic doesn't work and they are can be seen while preview the page.\n\nThe customer is on latest AEMFaaCS version 2023.12.14697.20231215T125030Z.\nAlso this was working fine earlier (till Jan) but all of sudden it stopped working, they have reverted back any changes made from there end (which were even not related to forms and pages) but still facing the issue.\nIssue is reproduible in all the environment.\n\ninvestigation done:\n\nOn inspecting the page and form we were able to notice that few clientlib css were not loading when previwing the page (though they were loading in case of preview the form), thus since the customer has campaign to be launced tomorrow, so as a workaround, same css files has been overlayed under /apps and issue is resolved temporarily.\n\n/core/fd/af-clientlibs/core-forms-components-runtime-all.lc-5b03b7abe7cd6cb6add203bc2da04277-lc.min.js\n\n/core/fd/af-clientlibs/core-forms-components-runtime-all.lc-bdc66562a2e97d627db172011be718aa-lc.min.css\n\n\nWe tried replicating the issue at our end and could see the issue is reproducible on Nov and December (latest) release.\n\n\nCustomer Details:\nColonial First state\n<https://author-p110482-e1080535.adobeaemcloud.com/ui#/aem/editor.html/content/cfs-winged/au/en/adviser/resources/10x1.html?appId=aemshell>\n\n\nLocal CM Details:\n\nNov Release:\nForm: <https://author-p28952-e887968.adobeaemcloud.com/editor.html/content/forms/af/siteformtest.html>\nPage: <https://author-p28952-e887968.adobeaemcloud.com/editor.html/content/test-site/test_UGC_form_submission/formshiddentest.html>\n\nDecember release:\n\nForm: <https://author-p122414-e1239929.adobeaemcloud.com/editor.html/content/forms/af/siteformhidden.html>\nPage: <https://author-p122414-e1239929.adobeaemcloud.com/editor.html/content/test-site/testpagehidden.html>\n\nGoing through the logs, nothing specific could be found.\nWe suspect something might be blocking the css to load on pages.\nKindly let me know if any other detail is required."

In iframe mode, the necessary client libraries are automatically included, but in non-iframe mode, they must be manually added via content policies, as outlined in the documentation.\n\nb) Has the customer modified the template settings for the page where the form is displayed?

I was able to find an old JIRA <https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/CQ-4335145|CQ-4335145> where we advise the below:\n\n“An HTML select element, when it receives focus, should open the menu using arrow keys or the spacebar (not the Enter key).\n The Enter key should be reserved for performing the action in the select menu, activating whatever is focused in the dropdown menu.\n\n So, on the initial page load, a user can activate the default option or make a selection with arrow keys, and then use the Enter key to activate that selection.\n [0] W3C reference: <https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_select>\nAs long as the Adobe select element:\n• can receive keyboard focus when tabbed to it\n• display a visual focus indicator when it has focus\n• opens the menu using either arrow keys or the spacebar\n• activates the chosen option (either the initial option, when applicable, or after choosing an option with arrow keys) using the Enter key\nthen it's accessible and uses standard keyboard actions”\n2.

    "answer": "Hi <@W4R5M9P4H> the issue arises when embedding a published form from the AEM Forms cloud service into an external website through an AJAX call. Currently, the scripting and details of the form are called before the form is DOM-ready, resulting in errors. Although a delay was added in the guideContainer.jsp to mitigate this issue, the delay exceeds 6 seconds, which is too long for a website.\n\nThe customer is looking for alternative methods to embed the form in an external website without relying on an AJAX call. This approach aims to ensure that the form functions correctly without requiring a lengthy delay."

    "answer": "To ensure that the form scripting and details are called after the DOM is ready, you can modify your script to execute the `loadAdaptiveForm` function after the DOM has fully loaded. You can use the `DOMContentLoaded` event for this purpose.\nHere’s how you can modify your script:\n\n```<script>\ndocument.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", function() {\n    var options = {\n        path: \"/content/forms/af/locbasic.html\",\n        dataRef: \"\",\n        themepath: \"\",\n        CSS_Selector: \".customafsection\"\n    };\n    loadAdaptiveForm(options);\n});\n\nvar loadAdaptiveForm = function(options) {\n    // Your existing loadAdaptiveForm function code here\n    // <https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/content/forms/adaptive-forms-basic-authoring/embed-adaptive-form-external-web-page.html?lang=en#:~:text=You%20can%20embed%20an%20adaptive,in%20the%20specified%20form%20container>.\n};\n</script>```\nThis modification ensures that the `loadAdaptiveForm` function is called only after the DOM has fully loaded. This should help in resolving the issue of the scripting and details of the form being called before the DOM is ready."

In order for a reference to OutputService to be injected, it needs to be in a class that is a Component managed by OSGi.\n\nIn your particular case I believe that you have a custom servlet which is an OSGI component. So you can do one of the following:\n• Have a reference to OutputService in your Servlet and then invoke the appropriate APIs\n• Convert the POJO class `org.nfcu.aec.core.services.docgen.impl.OutputServiceImpl` into an OSGI Service. You can make use of the documentation at <https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/cloud-service/developing/osgi-services/basics.html?lang=en> for more details.

When we submitted the AEM Forms, the third party flagged the following as non-compliant with accessibility.\n\n1.\tField-level error messages are bound to the corresponding fields using aria-labelledby. This causes conflicts with the existing usage of aria-label. Aria-describedby should be used for error text. This is observable for the following control elements: fields based on input markup, such as date picker, email, phone and similar. The same situation can be noticed also on additional controls such as radio buttons and checkboxes. [1]\n2.\tThere are form controls with visual labels that are not programmatically associated with the control. For example, for the “checkbox” control, the label element does not have the “for” attribute to identify the element which label is pointing to. Impact: Screen reader users will have difficulty determining the purpose of these controls. Speech input users will have difficulty navigating to them. [1]\n\nRequest:\n\n-\tPlease confirm whether these are known issues by Adobe. Also, which standards have been followed. AEM Adaptive Forms are not specified as AEMaaCS product. [2]\n\n-\tIf this is a known issue, kindly provide a recommendation or roadmap for resolution, detailing plans for fixes/releases.\n\n[2] <https://www.adobe.com/accessibility/compliance.html>"
