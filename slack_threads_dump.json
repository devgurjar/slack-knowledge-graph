Also, what import package statement needs to be added in core pom.xml. Can someone provide some clarity on this, please?",

This solves one of the main challenges of AEM applications by keeping you current on the most recent version.\nThe customer environments were in the RO, and that is the default and recommended approach, and the upgrades are automatic for all the environments. The Feature updates are rolled out at the same time, one by one, on each environment: DEV, Stage, and Prod.\n\n--&gt; Discount Tyre is currently out of RO because of rollback.\n\n--&gt; First, the customer needs to fix their custom code, then test the changes in your dev environment, and once confirmed that the issue is fixed, we will upgrade the stage and prod. And then re-enable on RO.\n\n--&gt; The documentation pointed by Deke[0]. This happens when a customer is out of RO and has made a request to make the upgrade process manual.\nBy default and as the recommended approach, the customers are in RO, and automatic updates take place on the customer environment in all environments.\n\n[0]:<https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/implementing/deploying/aem-version-updates>",

Suggested enabling the property for adaptive forms in the template and checking if it resolved the issue.

There are two inputs elements with this class.\n\n3. Remove the style attribute with dsiplay none and the submit button will be visible in the form.\n\nReproduceable environment: <https://author-p138853-e1404402.adobeaemcloud.com/ui#/aem/aem/forms.html/content/dam/formsanddocuments>",

As far as hidden submit button with class `guideContainerFormSubmitButton` is concerned, it is added by Form Container component [0]. This is not specific to any template. It is part of product and should be present in any form created using any foundation component template. The purpose of the submit button is a dummy submit for capturing data for auto-fill use case. If this is causing any accessibility issue, this can be fixed by adding `aria-hidden=\"true\"` to the html element. Please raise an accessibility issue for the same.\n2. For issue about `.hidden` class, this is very generic class name to represent `display:none` . Please ask customer to remove this class whenever navigation link is clicked, add it back when toggled.

Important property in CSS takes precedence over other styles, which is causing the problem.\nFor this problem, I am recommending that class `hidden`  should be removed for the div block to be displayed whenever. Add `hidden`  class back when it needs to be hidden. This is general best practice. Leaving hidden class as is for a div block being displayed doesn't make sense. Once this class is removed dynamically from the div, the bootstrap styling won't be effective anymore, and the block will be visible. The purpose of hidden class is to keep the element hidden, therefore bootstrap library enforces it using `!important` . We need to ensure that we are following styling best practices.",

Create a custom theme and make required styling changes and apply the theme to the form\n2. If styling changes are required for only few elements, style layer in editor can be used as well.\nSimilarly `font-family` can be configured at page level element in the custom theme.\nCustom client library should be used for the cases which can't be achieved through theme.\nSo, our recommendation is to create a custom theme [0], and make button, font-family and other form element related changes and apply it to the form.\n\nIt seems customer has defined all forms related styling in a client library - <https://www.ebrd.com/etc.clientlibs/ebrd_dxp/clientlibs/clientlib-site.lc-14cdd813dc9a15d4b6c870a892050e23-lc.min.css>\nThis is not a good practice in my opinion, as it will lead to a conflict with the theme styling, and we are seeing the same cases here.

This was a concern for maintaining the implementation over time. Along with that causes issues with the Multiline field.

Granite Util Localization Issue:\n   - The `granite.get` function is undefined, causing errors in the console when used for localization of the character counter.\n   - Alternative solutions attempted include adding `granite.util` to the client library, but this resulted in a spinner being displayed instead of the character counter.\n   - The Granite.i18n localization is not exposed, so you can use the other way[0], which is safe to use.

Backend Class Challenges:\n   - The backend code forces overriding inherited methods.\n   - The customer explored using Lombok as an alternative but noted that it is not recommended for production use. \n   - Confirmed that certain elements need to be overridden when extending abstract classes.\n   - Highlighted safety mechanisms like versioning (e.g., V1, V2) for components to ensure stability during upgrades.\n\n3. CSS Overlay Confirmation:\n   - The customer sought confirmation on whether to use the default CSS or create a custom CSS folder for the text input component. They can create a custom one or use the default CSS, but this folder should be present in the folder structure of the custom component.\n\n4. Hide/Show Functionality Bug:\n   - Resetting radio buttons to hide/show text fields does not reset the character counter, even though the data is reset. Discussion on E-001628519.\n\n5.

      "Issue Description :\nOne of our Customers NFL has raised a concern where they are facing issues while trying to submit a form. They are having a custom submit action which is supposed to pick up the attachments from the form fields on publish and upload them into Author's DAM. To achieve this, team has written an upload API which makes a access token call(via a cloud manager API in Developer console) first to authenticate and then creates a folder and upload the assets. (code attached)\n\nCurrently, this is failing with error [0][1], though customer confirmed that it was working when instead of passing the client id and client secret to make use of cloud manager API, they had tested it using the local access token from AEM developer console.\nAs of now when adding the logic to have both ways (Cloud manager's API + Local access token), it is not working for either one.\n\nInvestigation :\nWe have confirmed with debugger at customer's local setup that the API for token generation &amp; fetch works and the generated token is fetched by the service correctly though when submitting the form, it gives a 401 unautorized and the custom submit actions returns a 500 response as well stating [1] though customer confirmed that there is no additional scripts which needs to be invoked.\n\nWhen checking the scope of cloud manager's API, below are the paramters :\nopenid, AdobeID, read_organizations, additional_info.projectedProductContext, read_pc.dma_aem_ams\n\nAuthor URL in-house :\n<https://author-p138853-e1404402.adobeaemcloud.com/content/dam/formsanddocuments/licensee-application/jcr:content?wcmmode=disabled>\n\nPublisher URL in-house :\n<https://publish-p138853-e1404402.adobeaemcloud.com/content/forms/af/licensee-application.html>\n\n[0] <http://com.adobe.aem.forms.af|com.adobe.aem.forms.af>.rest.internal.servlets.AdaptiveFormSubmitServlet Exception during form submission\njava.lang.RuntimeException: You are not authorized to submit this form.401\n\n[1]  <http://com.adobe.aem.forms.af|com.adobe.aem.forms.af>.rest.internal.servlets.AdaptiveFormCustomFunctionProviderServlet Failed to load custom functions from: , clientlib has no scripts\n\nAEM Version : 2024.11.18751.20241128T090041Z\nCore component Version : 3.0.74\n\n<https://splunk.or1.adobe.net/en-US/app/TA-aem_skyline/search?q=search%20index%3D%22dx_aem_engineering%22%20aem_service%3Dcm-p135215-e1328542%20aem_tier%3Dpublish%20level%3DERROR%20sourcetype%3Daemerror%20(%22*clientlib%20has%20no%20scripts*%22%20OR%20%22401%22)&amp;display.page.search.mode=smart&amp;dispatch.sample_ratio=1&amp;earliest=-24h%40h&amp;latest=now&amp;sid=1737599255.7797_E2F13C25-F1FF-43F3-9646-E3C74E66724E|https://splunk.or1.adobe.net/en-US/app/TA-aem_skyline/search?q=search%20index%3D%22dx_a[…]w&amp;sid=1737599255.7797_E2F13C25-F1FF-43F3-9646-E3C74E66724E>\n\nPlease advise.",

This shows a 503 and when user retries submission it submits fine after 2.1 min, does it save into the original folder for initial submission in sharepoint for second submit action, or does 503 actually cause persistence but empty noise(I believe this is the case due to the observation below)?

You can refer to this guide : <https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/implementing/content-delivery/cdn-configuring-traffic|CDN Configuration Guide>.\n• When handling large payloads, the UI thread remains blocked, waiting for a response, which can take approximately 8–10 minutes to complete. The timeout setting acts as a safeguard to prevent prolonged system hang-ups. If the CDN does not receive a response from the backend within the timeout period, it disconnects from the request. However, the backend thread continues execution independently, without being linked to the UI.timed out(does not receive any response from backend thread) it detaches itself from it. Backend thread continues execution but not attached to UI anymore."

      "Hi Team,\n\nOne of our customer reported an security concern, where their AWS security Team informed them that S3 Secret keys at Adobe Stage account were compromised and they managed to change it with new values with our help.\nBut they want to further investigate on why this happened.\nThis user account is used by Adobe to connect to our S3 bucket and upload documents.\nTheir security team shared below screenshot, on checking further could see this IP address which is reported belongs to Adobe \"<http://or1-egress-1.adobe.com|or1-egress-1.adobe.com>\" (as per multiple internal JIRAs (192.147.128.10) is managed by Adobe IT and Network Team to scan customer's environment possibly) and user agent (in screenshot) has been identified as TruffleHog.\n```nslookup 192.147.128.10\n\nName:      192.147.128.10\nAddress 1: 192.147.128.10 <http://or1-egress-1.adobe.com|or1-egress-1.adobe.com>```\nTruffleHog is open-source security tool designed to detect secrets such as API keys, passwords, or other sensitive credentials in source code repositories, configuration files, and cloud environments.\nTherefore this event looks suspicious to the customer as they don't expect Adobe to use such tool against their environment.\n\nWe also asked the customer to provide information on IP and Usergent noticed on known legitimate calls (past 30 days), they mentioned -\nCurrently, access is permitted from any location and controlled solely via the application secret. Given that the data includes customer PII, implementing additional security controls is essential to ensure they comply with Privacy Act.\n\nSource IP:  20.167.32.137\nUserAgent:\n[aws-sdk-java/2.22.0 Linux/6.1.96-flatcar Java_HotSpot_TM__64-Bit_Server_VM/11.0.23+7-LTS-222 Java/11.0.23 vendor/Oracle_Corporation io/sync http/Apache cfg/retry-mode/legacy]\n\n\n```$ nslookup 20.167.32.137\n*** <http://noidsibxvip01.corp.adobe.com|noidsibxvip01.corp.adobe.com> can't find 20.167.32.137: Non-existent domain\nServer:  <http://noidsibxvip01.corp.adobe.com|noidsibxvip01.corp.adobe.com>\nAddress:  10.40.4.247```\n\nAsk:\n- wanted your confirmation to check if Adobe uses TruffleHog or any bot scan ?\n- If yes, is this activity on customer's end could be legitimate?\n- If it is confirmed that these calls are indeed legitimate Adobe requests, they would plan to implement IP filtering to restrict access to specific IP ranges.\n- If no, why trufflehog would be hitting this IP (192.147.128.10)\nAlso, It is possible that this is false-positive and detected user agent is wrong (eg it is not TruffleHog). Is it normal that such call was coming from Adobes 192.147.128.10 IP address?\n\nCustomer Details:\nHYUNDAI CAPITAL SERVICE\n779B1E3C654DF5E50A495FFE@AdobeOrg\nAEMaaCS (latest release)",

However, when we click on \"Yes,\" the test text box gets pre-validated. Similarly, with the dropdown, when we select \"test b,\" the text input gets hidden, but when we select \"test a,\" the text input gets pre-validated without clicking any next button. The expected behavior should be that the field does not get pre-validated unless the next or submit button is clicked.\n\nPlease find the below reproducible instance:\n<http://10.42.43.255:4502/editor.html/content/forms/af/validation.html>",
      "This issue occurs due to the ‘clear value’ rule when the text field is cleared after selecting ‘yes’ in the radio button. Clearing the value behaves similarly to a user manually removing data from the UI, and since the field is required, the error message appears.\n\nThis is expected behavior. If you want to bypass showing the field’s validity, you can explicitly mark the field as valid. However, doing this may allow the form to be submitted without the required field being filled out.",

This to them misuses the purpose of panel to contain multiple elements (or one) and forces one to wrap a single field in a panel to make use of validation .So now for a single field, that is mandatory , needs to be placed in a panel just because clear field (which to me is single field clearing) and reset panel is clearing multiple fields contained within it which can be single.",

But we were not able to see the behaviour in 2023 cloud sdk versions.\n\nCould see below JS function is preventing Enter key to take action on the click event for the selected component E,g: Submit button\n\n/**\n * Prevents the default behavior of the Enter key on components within the formContainer\n * from triggering a form submission and redirecting to the Thank-You Page.\n */\n#preventDefaultSubmit(){\n    if(this._element) {\n        this._element.addEventListener('keydown', (event) =&gt; {\n            if (event.key === 'Enter') {\n                event.preventDefault();\n            }\n        });\n    }\n}\n\nIn 2023 versions [0], we could notice, that on pressing enter, we could expand the dropdown menu and collapse as well, (space can only expand)\nand also, can submit the form using enter button.\nBut in 2024 versios [1] of cloud sdk, could see, we can only expand the dropdown menu and submit the form using Space key (and not Enter).\n\nAs per <https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/FORMS-12992> (not for core component) I understand, Enter's OOTB behaviour is to submit the form when focused on an element, but currently we cannot do it in 2024 core components.\n\nThis behavior is problematic for users relying on keyboard navigation, as the \"Enter\" key is often used to activate focused elements such as buttons and dropdown menus.\n\nThe customer expects the \"Enter\" key to work similarly to the \"Space\" key, triggering click events on focused elements, aligning with standard web practices.\n\n[0] <http://10.42.32.214:4502/content/dam/formsanddocuments/dropdown/jcr:content?wcmmode=disabled>  (2023 October version)\n\n[1] <http://10.42.32.232:4504/content/dam/formsanddocuments/dropdown/jcr:content?wcmmode=disabled> (2024 July version, also tested on April version)",

      "FIRSTBANK PUERTO RICO | E-001397323 - P1 | System not publishing in author.  Already publish forms to clients are not working",
      "Issue Reason : AEMFaaCS",
      "Hi Team,\n\nRequire your expertise on below issue:\nOne of our customer has reported an issue *(P1)* where their AEM website is not functioning correctly. The issue involves a critical failure in Adaptive form submissions and content publishing in the production environment for FirstBank Puerto Rico. Specifically, forms are getting stuck after submission, and authors are unable to publish changes in the production environment. The problem is isolated to the production environment, as staging is working fine.\n\nThe team observed cache-related log messages [0] in the error logs. Attempts were made to clear the CDN and Dispatcher cache (CSMEOPS-7346), but these did not resolve the issue.\n\nHAR indicates that no requests are initiated by form submission in prod, but works as expected/designed in stage.\n\n- Most recent deployment to prod via prod pipeline [3] [4] was performed on September 30th, Customer mentioned that this issue was initially reported at 5am Puerto Rico time (EST) the previous day, and now affects all forms on the site.\n- Customer reports that some analytics changes were made this morning, but not directly relevant to the site, they also confirmed that the same code, content and configs are working fine in stage.\n- Customer has requested that restarting the publisher to be performed but we assume, this won't help (raised SKYOPS-88239 for the same).\n-The forms submission have a POST URL endpoint on which the data gets submitted. Same endpoint is working fine in their STAGE.\n- We also tried submitting the form directly through AEM UI but same results (For author and publisher as well)\n- Could see error [1], when  trying to submit the form, On checking the network tab, there is no activity.\n-We also tried creating a new form for testing but same results with the POST URL.\n\n\n[0]\n[198.143.37.49 [1728585865938] GET /content/firstbankpuertoricoprogram/pr/es/personal/prestamo-de-auto.html HTTP/1.1] com.adobe.aem.formsndocuments.service.impl.StaleAssetIndicatorServiceImpl [StaleAssetIndicator] : Cache Stale due to dependant /conf/firstbankpuertoricoprogram/sling:configs/com.adobe.cq.wcm.core.components.internal.DataLayerConfig for asset /content/dam/formsanddocuments/simple-forms/3/pr/es/prestamo-de-auto-pr-es\n\n\n[1]\n [104.225.163.111 [1728623555046] GET /content/dam/formsanddocuments/simple-forms/3.folderthumbnail.jpg HTTP/1.1] com.day.cq.dam.core.impl.ui.preview.AbstractPreviewCreator Unable to create layer for /content/dam/formsanddocuments/simple-forms/3/pr/es/bakupprestamo-de-auto-pr-es\n\n [104.225.163.111 [1728623676545] GET /content/dam/formsanddocuments/simple-forms/3/pr/es/prestamo-de-auto-pr-es/jcr:content HTTP/1.1] com.day.cq.wcm.core.impl.reference.ContentPolicyReferenceProvider Policy under /libs won't be published: for policy path: /libs/settings/wcm/policies/wcm/foundation/components/responsivegrid/afpolicy, and for resource path: /conf/firstbankpuertoricoprogram/settings/wcm/templates/blank-af\n\n[2] <https://splunk.or1.adobe.net/en-GB/app/TA-AMS_ui/search?q=search%20index%3D%22dx_aem_en[…]&sid=1728624851.70693_75E8025B-8CA1-4E53-B9F1-31FCB54511E1>\n\n[3] <https://aemcs-workspace.adobe.com/customer/program/64062#pipelineExecutions>\n\n[4] <https://aemcs-workspace.adobe.com/customer/program/64062/pipeline/11981732/execution/4770037>",

What are your requirements? What is the expected load/TPS?\nDuring heavy load burst, our requirement is to process approx. 100K within a couple of hours.\n\nHoping for your kind response.",
      "Also the customer has inquired about the lack of pod autoscaling in the Stage environment during their performance tests. They observed HTTP 409 and 500 errors in the first couple of minutes, primarily from the active pods. Upon reviewing the logs within the specified timeframe, it appears that only two publish pods were handling the requests.\nCould you please cross-verify this with the Splunk logs and confirm if the autoscaling was triggered as expected?\n\nHoping for your kind response.",
      "Hi , please go through the following observations:\n• Batch APIs looks a better fit for this use-case. Has the customer explored them? \n• Regarding 400 errors, customer will need to check these at their end as customer is using a custom servlet here. We are not sure exactly which errors are reported as 400.\n• We are aware of 500s during instantaneous scaling from cold start (initial state) or very low replicas onwards. This phenomenon also subsides when system has scaled to a larger replica set. Regarding this, you need to define burst load parameters for us - how many req/s so that we can investigate and check internally whether/what we can do to support your use-case.\n• How is burst traffic being generated? These requests are either generated by external users outside customer’s control or by some process owned by the customer.\n• As  mentioned before, we already support 120K requests per hr, 100K/couple of hours should work as well.\n• I checked the splunk logs but was unable to find either 409 or 429 errors. I recommend you to check the customer’s code for these errors.\ncc: ,",
      "Hi Anirudh,\nThank you for responding.\nThe customer cannot use the batch API as their use case requires generating the PDF and returning it immediately. The burst traffic is generated using the LoadRunner tool, with the script employing 10 virtual users.\nLooking forward to your kind response.",
      "Hi ,\nHoping for your kind response.",
      ", can you please clarify the customer’s expectations here? I am reiterating ’s comment here\n&gt; basis the 8th Nov numbers you’ve shared, there are just two 5xx responses out of 30412 requests - that’s a 0.006% error rate, which should be well within the acceptable limit. So, I echo Anirudh’s question: what do they want from us?\nWith 0.006% error rate, the customer is expected to enable retries for failed request at their end to achieve 100% success.\nI can confirm that auto-scaling is enabled on stage and prod environments. There are two standing pods always but as the load increases additional pods are spun up to handle it. There may be a warmup delay for the new pod to be active. The customer should increase the load gradually to align with the autoscaling. Does burst traffic being generated using LoadRunner tool mimic actual traffic?\ncc:",

The Analytics integration is working and they see data now in Workspace (pulling the props and events set up in AEM). The Launch integration was also done in AEM. In addition to the configuration changes done in AEM, in Launch, the AEM Form extension is added in the property. There is a custom event that should fire when the form is submitted using the documentation:\n<https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-65/content/forms/integrate-aem-forms-with-experience-cloud-solutions/integrate-aem-forms-with-adobe-analytics>\n\nOn one of the forms where the AEM Forms integration with Launch has been set up and on submitting the form, Using the Adobe Debugger we can see the Analytics integration props and events firing. For the custom event (Rule) set up in Launch that should fire on form submit,  with the Rule to set some evars and props and an event. We do not see this data in the debugger, as suspected the rule isn't firing.\n\nRequesting your input on this.\n\nBelow are the URL's of the customer.\n\n<https://www.ig.ca/en/why-ig/tax>\n<https://www.ig.ca/en/why-ig/tax-help>\n<https://www.ig.ca/en/why-ig/upgrade>\n<https://www.ig.ca/en/why-ig/second-opinion>\n<https://www.ig.ca/en/why-ig/retirement>\n<https://www.ig.ca/en/why-ig/retirement-plan>\n\nThis is the first time they are doing this &amp; it is impacting their campaign that is starting soon.",

The customer is now available.\n\nAlso, I discussed the issue with Tier 3 Analytics .\n\nFeedback from Analytics Tier 3: I think the issue here is that the AEM team created an extension in the launch. There is no support team at adobe that supports Launch Extensions. The closest would be the product team, so in this case, it'd be the AEM support team that supports how the AEM launch extension functions. The AEM launch extension has a dropdown that just says, \"fire launch rules with 'Event Type:Submit' occurs\" . launch rule is either not happening because\n(1) 'Event Type: Submit' is not firing, therefore the launch rule doesn't fire or 'Event Type: Submit' fires, but\n(2) the launch javascript listening for it doesn't run because the page navigates away before the javascript can complete, or\n(3) There's an issue with AEM where either the configuration isn't triggering the correct form submit that launch is listening for, or\n4) it's all broken on the AEM side of things and this is the only customer that has reported it\n\nIf the AEM product team could let us know how to trigger the javascript event that this is specifically listening for then we could probably pinpoint the issue",

We encountered an error when attempting to access the URL directly.\n\nAlso, besides using the 'submit to rest endpoint' option, you could create a custom submit action based on your configuration needs and usage preferences, providing a potential solution to the form submission issue.\n\nRecommended customer to verify if the endpoint is accessible via Postman or directly, and if not, consider IP whitelisting as a potential cause for the inaccessibility.\n\n[0]:<https://github.com/adobe/aem-core-forms-components/tree/master/it/apps/src/main/content/jcr_root/apps/forms-core-components-it/customsubmission/logsubmit>\n[1]:<https://github.com/adobe/aem-core-forms-components/blob/master/it/core/src/main/java/com/adobe/cq/forms/core/components/it/service/CustomAFSubmitService.java>```",

We have a newer approach, the current approach that you are currently using, you are rendering the whole form from the server and amending it as the whole HTML, and with this approach, you will not be able to use the spa editor to kind of drag, drop and create the form there itself so.\nSo with the introduction of headless adaptive forms, there are two approaches that we can follow. If you're authoring the form within the site page, then you'll be able to drag and drop the competence there itself. There is a PR that you may have to just check if currently you are using out-of-the-box core components or custom components.\nSo with this merge on a page itself, we would be able to drag and drop these core components right for SP. You'll have to integrate the changes because you have already created a page, so you'll have to integrate one time. \nAs discussed, this PR[0] is still a work in progress and we trying to get this merged as soon as possible but we do not have a fixed timeline on the same.\nAs for the suggestions and the approaches that we discussed over the call, please drop an email at <mailto:tanvia@adobe.com|tanvia@adobe.com>, we would be happy to help and keep you posted.\n[0]:<https://github.com/adobe/react-starter-kit-aem-headless-forms/blob/main/src/Form.tsx>```",

You can perform the relevant GET operation the on the entity itself which has that property in which the api request parameter exist.\nIn this case we are trying to achieve to use GET operation on an entity and use input parameter from another referenced entity - that is not supported.\nEntity which contains the input parameter - if MS provide GET operation for that entity, GET should be performed on that entity itself to query.\n\nYou are adding GET operation on bopcms_erqemployment entity and adding an operation argument from referenced entity named bopcms_incident, that is not supported as of now.\nPlease use the GET service of the bopcms_incident entity directly.

They have a use case of connecting to Dynamics (custom connectivity using oData), and they would like to know if we see challenges with nested panels persisting into CRM and how mapping is envisioned and done along with any know how's and best practices.\n\nThey are concerned with the doc [1] comment where it is said under \"The curious case of repeatable panels\", \"Do not use unbound fields in bound repeatable panels\". They have put mulitple fields which are unbound inside a bound panel and do not have any bidning in FDM and they are able to sent it to their submit endpoint without any issues therefore, they would like to understand what this statement signifies and what are the different inconisistency it can bring.\n\n[0] <https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/forms/adaptive-forms-authoring/authoring-adaptive-forms-core-components/create-an-adaptive-form-on-forms-cs/create-forms-repeatable-sections>\n[1] <https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/forms/adaptive-forms-authoring/authoring-adaptive-forms-foundation-components/prepopulate-adaptive-form-fields#:~:text=protecting%20your%20data.-,The%20curious%20case%20of%20repeatable%20panels,-Generally%2C%20bound%20(form>",

      ",, customer is using both types of forms,, though they are inclined to move towards the core component based forms as of now. \nIf they make use of Core components,, is this comment not applicable for them?\nAnd can they have unbound fields inside a bound panel?",

Can you get this is the case with customer, as data will sync between unbound fields inside bound repeatable panel. And you said customer's use case is working, if they want this syncing of unbound fields inside bound repeatable panel, then they should be good.",
      ", Thank you so much for clarifying this on foundation vs the core components.\nCan you please elaborate on the part of \"syncing of data between unbound fields\" on foundation components?\n\nCustomer has just used some unbound fields in a repeatable bound panel for both foundation based as well as core component and these fields are just for maintaining some count and flags  which are being passed onto the endpoint.",
      "core components don't have a concept of bound and unbound fields.\nIn foundation components based adaptive form when I said data syncing of unbound field in a bound repeatable panel, that means the data of only one unbound field would be submitted. For example say there is a repeatable panel bound to children in schema. and authour has put one unbound filed inside this panel say field 'xyz'. When data is submitted then all the children data would be submitted (array of objects, in case its json schema based form, XML elements in case its XFA or XSD based form), in'bound' section of submitted data. Whearas in 'unbound' section of data, only one instance of data for field 'xyz' would be submitted. That is, when form filler repeats the panel, the unbound field inside the bound repeatable panel will hold one value for all repeated instances.",
      "You can schedule a call, if you need more clarity.",

For instance, core components are based on this specification: <https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-headless-adaptive-forms/assets/Headless-Adaptive-Form-Specification.pdf|Headless Adaptive Form Specification>. This should address all your relevant questions.\n\nIf there are any additional questions, , I recommend opening a documentation ticket so that we can enhance the documentation accordingly.",

Additionally, this will need to be done for every dropdown.(e.g we have 10 dropdowns in the form, we need hidden fields for all of them)\n- Additionally, there might be race condition involved with this approach. If you have an invoke service and you're doing a drop down on initialize, the Dropdown might look for the values.

Though, While sending a PUT request, somehow, CRM does not send the child elements of the JSON (limitation at Microsoft side, customer is checking more with MS on this), therefore, customer wants to send multiple put requests before submitting the form for each of the child elements.\n\nWorkaround they are trying :\n1. They are following this[0] suggestion though are not able to make it work due to abstract nature of submitForm method and guidelib.dataIntegrationUtils.executeOperation(operationInfo, inputs, outputs, null, null,)\n\n2. They want to know if they go with workflows to achieve this use case, can the workflow be used to send data/error msg back to publish from author? &amp; if there are any impacts in running workflows with multiple PUTs\n\nAny guidance is appreciated!

Workflows run asynchronously. Form submission will queue a job and submission will return indicating success. The job will be picked up asynchronously to execute the steps consecutively.\n2. There is no configuration required on author or publish for form submission on publish to trigger workflow on author.  When form submission happens on publish, the form data would be posted from the client to a submission API on publish which would send the data to author for workflow processing. No form data is stored on publish during form submission. We can also avoid storing form data on author using external persistence of workflow data.

      "Call Summary:\n\n```As discussed over the call, in the use case that you have and trying to implement, you have multiple PUTS that you need to incorporate in AEM Forms as a Cloud service.\nIn case of multiple PUTS and having different tables in circular reference, only one of those would be updated.\nNow use the case we have multiple ways:\n\n1) Workflows\n\nWith workflows, There's one piece where communication to the front end would be an asynchronous thing. The communication to the front end to display any sort of errors would be the main thing. Along with send email functionality which would have to be customized according to the use case. You can use different email templates which would create more placeholders and start showing in the send email component.\n\nAs for the workflow part, you have concerns about the performance of the workflows.\n\nWorkflows run asynchronously and there you would get a notification that the workflow is triggered, but the actual step execution can happen with a delay.\nThe delay will be in milliseconds, but it also depends on the load or how many workflows you are trying to trigger per second which will translate to how many Forms submissions you are trying to do.\n\nSo, as discussed we would require an approximate idea of the load that is going to come. Also, this would be impacted on the dynamics data and their environment which we would need from dynamics teams. Also, this dynamics latency would be better answered by dynamics teams. \nThe dynamics instance the region where the service is located and where AEM is located, all would add to you know the performance.\n\nWorkflow execution happens asynchronously like there are multiple steps, some of them run in a single thread until it find a participant step/decision-making step.\nBased on the information shared and shown, the performance of this particular Workflow would be limited by the number of put calls that you are making. Performance-wise that is not going to be a big difference unless there are a large number of Forms submissions and there is a huge number of workflows being so executed and they all have to run. So we'll be limited by the number of threads that can run.\n\nSo with your workflows with a large number of users or a large number of Forms submissions, we could have some performance issues. Plus there is an additional call that is going from the publish instance to the author and so there is that round trip time right for that. Plus workload answers synchronously, so you'll not catch your errors. Also, Workflow stores all the information within the AEM instance. So if you have PII data, we suggest that that data goes to an external database that is a customer's own database.\nSo, there are these concerns with using workflows.\n\n2) To run multiple invoke services on the submit action item. But for this, you will require a custom error handler. You tested the same at your end and was working. As of now, there are some issues with the invoked service in the latest version that would need to be looked into.\n\n3) Using Guidelib \n\nAs discussed, that is not the recommended approach because of submission capabilities. When you use one of the submit actions of the form right, like sending email or invoking form data or any of these. There are multiple things that you get like server-side validation of the form and then captcha integration. You will not be able to dark those capabilities. All these things are coming along with the submit action and you will miss out on these things when you use the guide Lib functions.\n\n4) Using a Custom Submit button\n\nAs discussed, you need more information on this way to have a custom submit button with FDM. \nSo, as mentioned we will Share public documentation and samples for FDM API to facilitate custom submit action development. The engineering team is looking into that and will share the same with you shortly.\nAs discussed this would be one of the best options for this use case.```",

So we'll be limited by the number of threads that can run.\n\nSo with your workflows with a large number of users or a large number of Forms submissions, we could have some performance issues. Plus there is an additional call that is going from the publish instance to the author and so there is that round trip time right for that. Plus workload answers synchronously, so you'll not catch your errors. Also, Workflow stores all the information within the AEM instance. So if you have PII data, we suggest that that data goes to an external database that is a customer's own database.\nSo, there are these concerns with using workflows.\n\n2) To run multiple invoke services on the submit action item. But for this, you will require a custom error handler. You tested the same at your end and was working. As of now, there are some issues with the invoked service in the latest version that would need to be looked into.\n\n3) Using Guidelib \n\nAs discussed, that is not the recommended approach because of submission capabilities. When you use one of the submit actions of the form right, like sending email or invoking form data or any of these. There are multiple things that you get like server-side validation of the form and then captcha integration. You will not be able to dark those capabilities. All these things are coming along with the submit action and you will miss out on these things when you use the guide Lib functions.\n\n4) Using a Custom Submit button\n\nAs discussed, you need more information on this way to have a custom submit button with FDM. \nSo, as mentioned we will Share public documentation and samples for FDM API to facilitate custom submit action development. The engineering team is looking into that and will share the same with you shortly.\nAs discussed this would be one of the best options for this use case.\n\nBased on the discussion, Using a Custom Submit button would be one the best approach according to your use case that you have shared as engineering suggested over the call.\nCustom Submit documentation is here[0] and  Dermis Bridge api details are documentated here[1].\nI am attaching a sample for your reference to help you with the implementation and Dermis API calls. This is just a sample that we can provide you to go through with the use case and implementation. You will have to make the necessary changes according to your specific use case and implementation.\n[0]:<https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/forms/[…]tions-and-metadata-submission/custom-submit-action-form>\n[1]:<https://javadoc.io/static/com.adobe.aem/aem-forms-sdk-api/2021.11.18.00/com/adobe/aem/dermis/api/bridge/IDermisBridge.html>\n\nyou can use this method[0] as an alternative, which takes IValueMap instead of JSONObject(deprecated).\n[0] : <https://javadoc.io/static/com.adobe.aem/aem-forms-sdk-api/2021.11.18.00/com/adobe/aem/dermis/api/bridge/OperationOptions.html#%3Cinit%3[…]IValueMap>)\n\nthe error[0] is due to the jsonObjectToValue method. The IvalueMap function would work, however this test case will fail. To address the same we have logged a Jira FORMS-15623 with engineering team. As of now, in case this test case is causing high concerns, you can use JsonObject library for temporary use case and then once the fix is available can use the IValueMap.\n\n[0]:java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/adobe/aem/dermis/api/util/JsonUtils\n\tat com.adobe.aem.dermis.util.ValueUtil.jsonObjectToValue(ValueUtil.java:502)```",

      "[Update]\n\n and ,\nThank you for providing your insights and guidance to resolve this issue.\n\nI had a connect with customer and they are good with the resolution provided.\n\n*Following were the pointers which helped us resolve this issue :*\n• It is very important to understand that when calling outputService.generatePDFOutput(), it is very crucial to set the ContentRoot correctly as using this content root our fragments are resolved and not the relative referencing path given in main xdp for barcode. Therefore, always set the top level directory as your contentRoot (all your main XDP/XDP folder and fragment/ fragment folder is down the heirarchy). Resourceresolve sets a lock at the contentRoot and if your fragment folder is up the heirarchy than contentRoot, it would not be able to resolve it. Refer sample code attached. \n• Refrain from setting up absolute path say (\\content\\dam\\formsanddocuments\\fragments\\xdp\\barcode.xdp) as referencing path in the main XDP. Also refrain from giving relative path with resepect to main XDP as folders on the upper level say (../../barcode.xdp)\n• Provide the referencing path in the main XDP relative to your contentRoot. Ex : if your contentRoot is set as (/content/dam/formsanddocuments/af-personal/) and say your barcode is present at (/content/dam/formsanddocuments/af-personal/fragments/barcode.xdp) then provide the referencing path in main XDP as (./fragments/barcode.xdp). Given like this, when it comes to resolving the barcode.xdp fragment it would form a complete path as (/content/dam/formsanddocuments/af-personal/./fragments/barcode.xdp)\n• when calling the method outputService.generatePDFOutput(templateName, data, options), give templateName as full path of your main XDP (\"crx:///content/dam/formsanddocuments/af-personal/main-xdps/CM201-0822.xdp\"). If only name of XDP given, it would go under the folder where you have set the contentRoot to find the main XDP. \n• Another interesting thing which helped us resolve this issue is the SOM expression check which happens in Designer for each fragment. Go to Designer > click on fragment > check the name of fragment > check som expression in custom > it should be \"$template.form1.barcode\", if it is not this, the resolutions would not happen. \nAs suggested, I have logged a JIRA for keeping a documented record.\n<https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/FORMS-15100>\n\nMarking this as resolved for now.\n\ncc :",

Customer modified that to use formdata which was a string from the inputstream and got the bytes array from there to generate the XML which worked for them \n• Followed engineering suggestion to resolve the referenced image as well\n• They were having issues with Docker setup, when deployed the code to cloud instance, it worked like a charm"

The highlighted service users [aflac-service-user-service] is not able to find the workflow workitem or resourceResolver as mentioned in code snippet below :\n\n• They have created service user aflac-service-user-service with forced path system/cq:services\n• They have set principal ACL for aflac-service-user-service\n     allow jcr:all on /\n     allow jcr:all on /var\n     allow jcr:all on /var/workflow/instances\n     allow jcr:all on /content/dam\n\nBut it is not working for them.\nPlease advise",
      "Could you please check this",
      ", How is the code trying to find the workitem? Is it using the workflowSession.getWorkItem(&lt;workItemId&gt;)?\n\nIf so, there is an additional access check that checks if the current user is the assignee of the workitem or belongs to the assignee group. So, if the service user is not the assignee or part of the assignee group, then it wont be able to access the workitem.\n\nIs there a constraint on accessing the workitem using the assignee resource resolver?\n\nOne option could be to add the service user as a super user in the OSGi config Adobe Granite Workflow Service. But it requires evaluation as to whether you need to add this service user as a super user and bypass these kinds of checks.\n\nAlso, you will need to provide jcr:read on /var/workflow/models as well",
      "Hi ,\nThank you for looking into this one! &amp;\nApologies for the delay in response.\nCustomer has been a bit unresponsive.\nThough I have got the confirmation that, yes it is indeed using workflowSession.getWorkItem(&lt;workItemId&gt;) to find the workitem and the concerned service-user is an assignee as well, still it is having issues.\n\nI have requested the entire code and logs from the customer and I will be attaching in here for further troubleshooting.",
      "Hi , please find below the java files and configuration that customer tried at their end :\n\n• AdobeSignScheduler_WitServiceUser.java\nIn log.

      ":ackd:",
      "I am taking a look",
      "The service user is created with name “aflac-service-user-service”. I hope there is a service user mapping also available.\n```\"org.apache.sling.serviceusermapping.impl.ServiceUserMapperImpl.amended~wfsignstep\":{\n      \"user.mapping\":[\n        \"&lt;bundleGroupId&gt;.&lt;artifacId&gt;:aflac-service-user=[aflac-service-user-service]\"\n      ]\n    }```\nOtherwise resource resolver resolves to anonymous and then query results will be 0",
      "To get service resource resolver,\n```private ResourceResolver getResourceResolver() {\n try {\n    Map<String,Object> paramMap = new HashMap<String,Object>();\n    paramMap.put(ResourceResolverFactory.SUBSERVICE, SERVICE_USER_ACCOUNT);\n    ResourceResolver resourceResolver = resolverFactory.getServiceResourceResolver(paramMap);\n    return resourceResolver;\n} catch (LoginException e) {\n//log it or do required action\n}\n}```",
      "This is what worked for me with similar code on my local set up",

They want to pause their instance with program \"p115977\".\n- I have raised <https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/SKYOPS-77879> for this ask. Please do let me know if additional approvals are needed for the same.\n\n2. They want the releases paused until Adobe can establish a process for rolling out releases in dev and test environments, give them 2 weeks to perform testing and then deploy to stage and PROD.\n\n3. Customer wanted to know if the releases could be rolled out to DEV/TEST environments first or if they can do their validations on Stage before they approve releases for PROD.\n- I raised this internally and found the below answers:\na. Update process is fully automated – there are no manual approvals required or available and moving to group 30/40 won't help with this. See: <https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-manager-cloud-service/content/implementing/deploying/aem-version-updates#ci-cd>\nb. Releases goes automatically. Usually at the same day for dev, then stage, then prod. No need to manage Update button anymore but DEV instances can be updated automatically EARLIER (on the same day the release is available; no need to click Update button) – this is possible if we move Customer to special groups 30/40.\n\n- Customer has raised a follow-up query on what these groups are and how can they be enrolled in it.\n\nPlease let me know your feedback on these queries raised.",

      "Issue Reason : AEMFaaCS",
      "Reference Ticket# E-001233459",
      "Our customer \"*HDI AG*\" reporting an issue that adaptive form submissions fails intermittently because of prolonged DoR generation.\nCustomer is facing this in PROD and DEV server and they were able to replicate this issue in DEV server with a simple AF of one field.\n\nThe custom submit action logic:\n- it generates and sends an email with DoR, attachments *and JSON data* to an email address polled by some automation tools of HDI.\n- then, it delegates the creation and sending of another email (to the person submitting the form) to the default Email Submission Action.\n\n# Expected behavior\nOnce a user clicks \"submit\" the submission process is handled promptly and returns a success message to the user.\n\n# Actual behavior\nOnce a user clicks \"submit\", intermittently the submission process takes a very long time, resulting in a timeout for the client. The user does not get any success message and thus re-sends the form . This results in the same data being submitted twice or even more.\n\n# Business impact\nThe impact is two-fold. On the business-side (HDI) it is a huge effort to determine if a submission has been sent twice, as the sent email automatically starts a number of business processes with other systems.\nOn the client-side, customers, although they have clicked on the \"submit\" button are being returned to the Adaptive Form without any message (neither success or failure). This is a bad look for HDI, as the process to fill in and submit forms is one of the key touch points of the customer experience, where trust and reliability of HDI is of utmost importance.\n\n# Initial analysis\nAs the issue occurs intermittently, it is hard to reproduce. customer were able to isolate one occurrence in a recent logfile though, where rendering of a minimal DoR (just one text field) took 120256 milliseconds. It is attached to the issue.\nAlso attached is another excerpt, where you can see that the same form and DoR usually takes much less time during rendering (e.g. 332, 5230, 419 ms)\n\nCustomer's AEM forms version :2024.4.15860.20240410T113939Z\nDEV env (where issue is reproducible):<https://author-p69952-e617152.adobeaemcloud.com/ui#/aem/aem/formdetails.html/content/dam/formsanddocuments/eggs-test/email-submission-test?appId=aemshell>\n\nPFA the logs.\n\nAny inputs on this?",

      "Issue Reason : AEMFaaCS",
      "Reference Ticket# E-001210624",
      "Hi Team,\n\nThe customer is trying to mimic \"Sign Document\" component in a customized way.\n\nThe out of box \"Sign Document\" component works fine for the below points:\n- Send the document to recipient for signature\n- Current workflow gets stopped or paused until the document gets signed.\n- When workflow is waiting for the signature, the status of the workflow is \"Running\"\n- As soon as signer completes all the signatures, workflow checks for status from adobe sign and completes the \"Sign Document\" component step.\n\n\nThe customer has tried to customize and mimic this but there are minor issues they are facing:\n\nExample # 1\nThey customized the component:\n- They send the document to signer.\n- They put Thread.Wait() function to check the status of the document signature in a while loop.\n- As soon as document status gets changed from \"OUT FOR SIGNATURE\", it completes the Component step.\n\nUntil signer signs the document, their code using java Thead.Wait() keeps waiting and checking the status of the document from adobe sign and this Thread.Wait() blocks the thread of the code which limits the number of instances (Workflow) that can be run on the server. It blocks the thread to run concurrently as AEM can allow multiple workflow threads to run concurrently. By default the number of threads is configured to be half the number of processor cores on the system.\n\nExample # 2\nThey also tried to suspend the workflow before Thread.Wait() and resume the workflow once they have status change but it creates the same problem. Only difference is the status of the Workflow gets change to SUSPENDED.\n\n\nThe customer has thought of a workaround to suspend the workflow and resume based on adobe sign webbhook but their workflow would go to suspended state which will not mimic out of box \"Sign Document\" component, but they need help on how this can be implemented.\n\nBelow is the call recording with customer for more details on the issue:\n<https://adobe-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/p/rahulpandey/ERBD3DEcDopCtZ2QEjUT7TgByycVuoBHl5h4cxmsevoALw?e=DSl7Tq>\n\n\nBelow are the customer's instance details..\nAEM Release : 2024.4.15860.20240410T113939Z\nAuthor url : <https://author-p60469-e738775.adobeaemcloud.com>\nProgram ID : p60469",
      "Tagging ,",
      ", what is blocking the customer from using OOTB sign document step in the workflow? What is the use case for doing the mimicking?",
      "Thanks for your response.\n\nThe customer  has to customize Sign Document component in their workflow due to below business requirement.\n\n- Because, OOTB doesn't support multiple documents as input to sent for signature within single agreement ID.\nThey are seeing help if this can be supported OOTB.\n\nWith OOTB, it supports only one document as input and one document as output.\n\nTheir business requirement is, they should be able to pass multiple documents, which could send a single email to signers within a single agreementID and when signers sign the documents, they should be able to get all multiple documents in the same sequence as output.",
      "&gt; Because, OOTB doesn't support multiple documents as input to sent for signature within single agreement ID.\nYou can send multiple documents, by adding those as attachments in Adaptive form.  to confirm if same is supported in workflow. If so then the customer need not implement on his own.",
      "Yes, Attachments are supported in workflow step as well. One document has to be chosen mandatorily, and additional attachments can also be configured.",
      "These attachments are stitched together in a single agreement",
      "Thanks  and \nI have shared the solution to the customer\nWill share their feedback if any",
      "Thanks for your response yesterday.\nWe got a confirmation from customer that this would help them in achieving partial requirements only.\n\nThere are following business requirement where business want to set the following options from the UI like\n\na) Days Until Deadline.\nb) Reminder Email Frequency and\nc) Signature Process etc.\n\nAlthough, these options can be selected in \"Sign documents component\" but can not be parameterized unlike other options.\nIs there a way we can change it to variable?\n\neg. Signature process can be set as Parallel or Sequential on this component but can not be parameterized so that user can decide if a document is to be signed parallelly or sequentially from the UI.",
      "Requesting your feedback on the above",
      "Hi ,\nThe parameters mentioned above cannot be parameterized in the workflow. That would require enhancement of the sign document step.\n&gt; Signature process can be set as Parallel or Sequential on this component but can not be parameterized so that user can decide if a document is to be signed parallelly or sequentially from the UI.\nWhich UI do you mean? Workflow step UI has the option of selecting sequential/parallel by workflow author.\ncc:",
      "Hello \n\nThanks for your response\n\nThat is the reason they have to customize the \"sign document\" component to support business need.\nDo we have any document which can help the customer understand how \"sign document\" is designed to wait for signature after document is sent for signature?\nOr will you be able to come on a call with customer?\nThey have build the entire component and functionality.\nThey just need to understand how they can pause/suspend their workflow to wait for the signature.",
      "cc:",
      "What is required is to have a scheduler that would poll for sign status using an adobe sign api (with the agreement id) and only after the sign is complete, workflow step should be completed.",
      "Hello \n\nThanks for your feedback.\nThe customer is concerned on how the workflow can be paused to wait for the scheduler to signal to proceed with next steps.\nThey tried using workflow.suspend, but it only changes the status of the workflow and the workflow still goes through top to bottom without waiting.",
      "there is no need to pause the workflow. The workflow can continue to remain in RUNNING state. Their custom step should  be  marked as autoadvance = false. So when the step executes, it will do what requires to be done (creating agreement, etc) and workflow execution will stop there. The scheduler could run asynchronously, fetch the status and then advance the step (by doing workitem.complete)",

After this change, the deployment pipelines have started failing. The customer has provided logs indicating that removing form code and instances from CRX/DE did not resolve the issue, and they have requested a solution as soon as possible.\nInvestigation and Analysis\nSupport has reviewed the logs and has asked the customer to perform steps shared by the support team. A meeting was scheduled to discuss the issue in more detail. The support team has recognized the large impact of the issue on the customer's deployment processes and has indicated the involvement of product engineering team members if necessary.\nSupport has ensured that below steps has been performed :\n1\\. Delete from AEM Codebase: All Forms artifacts & Forms Folders from CRX & remove the following folder structures from CRX in the DEV environment after taking a snapshot of the instance :\nformsanddocuments\nformsanddocuments-fdm\nformsanddocuments-themes\n2\\.

      "As I can see in <https://aemcs-workspace.adobe.com/customer/tenant/67055> this is a Sites customer and does not have Forms license. On the cloud submit data is not supported to be stored on CRX, and it is recommended to submit it to a store managed by the customer.\n\nIf the customer is planning to buy Forms license - they could leverage the rich set of out of the box submit actions and connectors to allow submission to a REST endpoint, Azure blob store, SharePoint, OneDrive, Email, or invoke an AEM Workflow or PowerAutomate workflow. They could also leverage Form Data Model which can ease integration with other end-points.\nAlso, with Adaptive Forms Core components - they would have the same unified authoring in Sites page - as they may be accustomed to earlier.",

This has been flagged as per their accessibility audit.\n\nInvestigation done so far:\n\n 1. I was able to find an old JIRA <https://jira.corp.adobe.com/browse/CQ-4335145|CQ-4335145> where we advise the below:\n\n“An HTML select element, when it receives focus, should open the menu using arrow keys or the spacebar (not the Enter key).\n The Enter key should be reserved for performing the action in the select menu, activating whatever is focused in the dropdown menu.\n\n So, on the initial page load, a user can activate the default option or make a selection with arrow keys, and then use the Enter key to activate that selection.\n [0] W3C reference: <https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_select>\nAs long as the Adobe select element:\n• can receive keyboard focus when tabbed to it\n• display a visual focus indicator when it has focus\n• opens the menu using either arrow keys or the spacebar\n• activates the chosen option (either the initial option, when applicable, or after choosing an option with arrow keys) using the Enter key\nthen it's accessible and uses standard keyboard actions”\n2. The same information was shared with the customer. However, they still have the ask for Drop-Down to expand with the Enter key.\n3. Additionally, the reference HTML select element [0] also expands with the Enter key &amp; Space Bar key.\n\nAny suggestions on this?",

      "Hi  the issue arises when embedding a published form from the AEM Forms cloud service into an external website through an AJAX call. Currently, the scripting and details of the form are called before the form is DOM-ready, resulting in errors. Although a delay was added in the guideContainer.jsp to mitigate this issue, the delay exceeds 6 seconds, which is too long for a website.\n\nThe customer is looking for alternative methods to embed the form in an external website without relying on an AJAX call. This approach aims to ensure that the form functions correctly without requiring a lengthy delay.",
      "To ensure that the form scripting and details are called after the DOM is ready, you can modify your script to execute the `loadAdaptiveForm` function after the DOM has fully loaded. You can use the `DOMContentLoaded` event for this purpose.\nHere’s how you can modify your script:\n\n```<script>\ndocument.addEventListener(\"DOMContentLoaded\", function() {\n    var options = {\n        path: \"/content/forms/af/locbasic.html\",\n        dataRef: \"\",\n        themepath: \"\",\n        CSS_Selector: \".customafsection\"\n    };\n    loadAdaptiveForm(options);\n});\n\nvar loadAdaptiveForm = function(options) {\n    // Your existing loadAdaptiveForm function code here\n    // <https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-65/content/forms/adaptive-forms-basic-authoring/embed-adaptive-form-external-web-page.html?lang=en#:~:text=You%20can%20embed%20an%20adaptive,in%20the%20specified%20form%20container>.\n};\n</script>```\nThis modification ensures that the `loadAdaptiveForm` function is called only after the DOM has fully loaded. This should help in resolving the issue of the scripting and details of the form being called before the DOM is ready.",

      ", first the reference to Output Service shouldn’t be static\n`private static OutputService outputService;`\n\nSecondly, they are getting the reference as null because they have not declared their customer service as a OSGI Service/Component.

      "Let me elaborate a bit on Sufyan’s message.\n\nThe OSGi framework is responsible for ensuring that references to services are injected for all Components that are managed by the framework. In order for a reference to OutputService to be injected, it needs to be in a class that is a Component managed by OSGi.\n\nIn your particular case I believe that you have a custom servlet which is an OSGI component. So you can do one of the following:\n• Have a reference to OutputService in your Servlet and then invoke the appropriate APIs\n• Convert the POJO class `org.nfcu.aec.core.services.docgen.impl.OutputServiceImpl` into an OSGI Service. You can make use of the documentation at <https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-manager-learn/cloud-service/developing/osgi-services/basics.html?lang=en> for more details.

However, there is a miss in our implementation right now and it does not sync the custom models from /conf to /var. We have a ticket to take care of that.\n\nTill that improvement/fix comes from workflows, please add the /var/workflow/models/&lt;modelRelativePath&gt; also in the git repository (You could get this from local sdk). Pipeline then needs to be run to have the changes installed on the cloud instance.\n\ncc:  /",

When we submitted the AEM Forms, the third party flagged the following as non-compliant with accessibility.\n\n1.\tField-level error messages are bound to the corresponding fields using aria-labelledby. This causes conflicts with the existing usage of aria-label. Aria-describedby should be used for error text. This is observable for the following control elements: fields based on input markup, such as date picker, email, phone and similar. The same situation can be noticed also on additional controls such as radio buttons and checkboxes. [1]\n2.\tThere are form controls with visual labels that are not programmatically associated with the control. For example, for the “checkbox” control, the label element does not have the “for” attribute to identify the element which label is pointing to. Impact: Screen reader users will have difficulty determining the purpose of these controls. Speech input users will have difficulty navigating to them. [1]\n\nRequest:\n\n-\tPlease confirm whether these are known issues by Adobe. Also, which standards have been followed. AEM Adaptive Forms are not specified as AEMaaCS product. [2]\n\n-\tIf this is a known issue, kindly provide a recommendation or roadmap for resolution, detailing plans for fixes/releases.\n\n[2] <https://www.adobe.com/accessibility/compliance.html>",
